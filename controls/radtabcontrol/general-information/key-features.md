This is a list with short descriptions of the top-of-the line features of Telerik's __RadTabControl__.
				

* __Tab Content__ - place any kind of controls inside your tab items and build complex and flexible tabbed user interfaces.

* __Templates__ – RadTabControl has built in templates support, which gives you the power to fully customize the look & feel of your tab control. Use Expression Blend to edit existing templates or create new ones.

* __Powerful DataBinding__ - __RadTabControl__ can be bound to various data source types, such as Objects, Collections, XML and WCF services. [Read more]({%slug radtabcontrol-features-data-binding%})

* __Header Content__ – customize the header content of your __RadTabControl__ anyway you want. It is easy to put an image or other type of control inside your tab headers. [Read more]({%slug radtabcontrol-appearance-customizing-tab-items%})

* __Multi-line Tabs__ – group your tab items in different rows, separating them by some specific criteria. Just use the __RadTabItem__’s property __IsBreak.__ Once set, all tab items which are after that tab will be placed on a new row. [Read more]({%slug radtabcontrol-features-multiline-tabs%})

* __Tab Orientation__ – change the orientation of the tab items by using just a single property. You can then position either horizontally or vertically.

* __Tab Strip Placement__ – change the position of the tab strip by choosing one of the four possible options: __Left__, __Top__, __Right__ and __Bottom__. [Read more]({%slug radtabcontrol-how-to-change-the-position-of-the-tab-strip-of-radtabcontrol%})

* __Styling and Appearance__ - Telerik {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% else %}WPF{% endif %} TabControl can be fully customized using Expression Blend. There are also several pre-defined themes that can be used to style the tab control. Furthermore, Telerik unique style building mechanism allows you to change the skin’s color scheme with just a few clicks. 

* __UI Automation Support__ - as the Silverlight platform exposes a full accessibility tree through UIA (UI Automation), Telerik RadControls for Silverlight fully support UI Automation for UI elements access/manipulation, screen readers and other accessibility tools.
					

* __Enhanced Routed Events Framework__ - to help your code become even more elegant and concise, we implemented Enhanced Routed Events Framework for RadControls for {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %}.  This gives you more freedom when you design your applications, since you can write instance handlers as well as class handlers for the routed events of our controls.
					

* __Expression Blend support__ – all RadControls for {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %} can be easily customized using Expression Blend.
