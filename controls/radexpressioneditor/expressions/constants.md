__RadExpressionEditor__ allows you to use different constants for defining the expression you want. There are several types supported by the control:

* __Numeric constants__ - you may define just a simple numeric expression like:

	In case of __Double__ constant, you could use the exponential value: 0.0E+2. As a __Decimal__ constant you could use '0.0'. 

* __String constants__ - they need to be surrounded by double quotation marks:
