# {{ site.framework_name }} RadFluidContentControl Events

Except the inherited events, RadFluidContentControl exposes an additional event that allows you to listen for changes in the current state of the control. The event is called __StateChanged__ and it fires when the State property changes. The event arguments are of type __FluidContentControlStateChangedEventArgs__ and provide information for the newly applied state and the old one via the __OldState__ and __NewState__ properties.
