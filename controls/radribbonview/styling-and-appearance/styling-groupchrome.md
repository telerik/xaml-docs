# {{ site.framework_name }} RadRibbonView Styling the Ribbon GroupChrome

>tip In order to style the __GroupChrome__ control, which represents the uncollapsed group, you have to generate the default style for the __RadRibbonGroup__
{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}and modify its template{% endif %}. To see how to do it take a look at the [Styling the Ribbon Group]({%slug radribbonview-styling-ribbongroup%}) topic.

From the resources generated for the __RadRibbonGroup's__ style modify the __RadRibbonGroupStyle__, by clicking on its icon.				

It will be loaded in the 'Objects and Timeline' pane. Right-click on it and choose *Edit Template -> Edit Current*. In the 'Objects and Timeline' the parts of the __RadRibbonGroup's__ template will get loaded. Select the part called __ExpandedChrome__.

{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}
After generating the __RadRibbonGroup__'s default template and loading it in the 'Objects and Timeline' pane, select the __ExpandedChrome__ control.
{% endif %}

{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}
From the menu select *Object -> Edit Style -> Edit a Copy*. You will be prompted for the name of the style and where to be placed.
{% endif %}
{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}

>tip If you choose to define the style in Application, it would be available for the entire application. This allows you to define a style only once and then reuse it where needed.

After clicking 'OK', Expression Blend will generate the default style of the __GroupChrome__ control in the __Resources__ section of your User Control. {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %} The properties available for the style will be loaded in the 'Properties' pane and you will be able to modify their default values.If you want to change the __ControlTemplate__ elements of the __RadRibbonGroup__ select the style in the 'Objects and Timeline' pane, right-click on it and choose Edit Template -> Edit Current. In the same pane the element parts for the __RadRibbonGroup__'s template will get loaded.{% endif %}
{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %} The template for the __GroupChrome__ control will be loaded in the 'Objects and Timeline' pane. {% endif %}
![{{ site.framework_name }} RadRibbonView  ](images/RibbonView_Styling_GroupChrome_ControlTemplate.png)

{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}
Change the elements' properties until you get the desired look.

In this list you will find the brushes, styles and templates needed to change the visual appearance of the __GroupChrome__. Their names indicate to which part of the __GroupChrome's__ appearance they are assigned.
