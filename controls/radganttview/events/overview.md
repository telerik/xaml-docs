# {{ site.framework_name }} RadGanttView Overview

This topic covers the specific events exposed by __RadGanttView__.

__RadGanttView__ raises the following events, when a task is edited through the UI, in the order that they are shown below:

* __TaskEditing__: Occurs when the task editing is initiated through the UI. __Example 1__ demonstrates how you can handle the event in order to cancel the editing based on a specific condition.

	#### __[C#] Example 1: Canceling the editing of a task__
	{{region cs-radganttview-events-overview-0}}
		private void GanttView_TaskEditing(object sender, Telerik.Windows.Controls.GanttView.TaskEditingEventArgs e)
        {
            if (your condition here)
			{
				e.Cancel = true;
			}
        }
	{{endregion}}

	#### __[VB.NET] Example 1: Canceling the editing of a task__
	{{region vb-radganttview-events-overview-1}}
		Private Sub GanttView_TaskEditing(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As Telerik.Windows.Controls.GanttView.TaskEditingEventArgs)
			If your condition here Then
				e.Cancel = True
			End If
		End Sub
	{{endregion}}

* __TaskSaving__: Occurs when an edit operation is being committed through the UI. Please, note that you can handle this event to cancel the editing similarly to __Example 1__.

	The __TaskEditing__ and __TaskSaving__ events receive the following two arguments:

	* The sender argument contains the __RadGanttView__. This argument is of type object, but can be cast to __RadGanttView__ type.

	* A __TaskEditingEventArgs__ object. It contains the task that is being edited.
	
* __TaskEdited__: Occurs when a task has been edited through the UI. __Example 2__ demonstrates how you can handle the event in order to show a MessageBox indicating the __Duration__ of the task after it has been edited.

	* The sender argument contains the __RadGanttView__. This argument is of type object, but can be cast to __RadGanttView__ type.

	* A __TaskEditedEventArgs__ object. It contains the task that has been edited.

	#### __[C#] Example 2: Show Task duration after it has been edited__
	{{region cs-radganttview-events-overview-2}}
		private void GanttView_TaskEdited(object sender, Telerik.Windows.Controls.GanttView.TaskEditedEventArgs e)
        {
            var durationAfterEditing = e.Task.Duration;
            MessageBox.Show($"The duration after editing is - {durationAfterEditing}");
        }
	{{endregion}}

	#### __[VB.NET] Example 2: Show Task duration after it has been edited__
	{{region vb-radganttview-events-overview-3}}
		Private Sub GanttView_TaskEdited(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As Telerik.Windows.Controls.GanttView.TaskEditedEventArgs)
			Dim durationAfterEditing = e.Task.Duration
			MessageBox.Show($"The duration after editing is - {durationAfterEditing}")
		End Sub
	{{endregion}}
