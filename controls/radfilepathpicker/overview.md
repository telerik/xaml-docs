As every control from UI for WPF, RadFilePathPicker comes with a set of pre-defined themes. Of course, if you choose to do so, you can design your own templates for a completely custom look.

## Key Features

* __Dialog Type__:  The control allows you to choose the type of file dialog, which is opened. You can learn more about that in the [Dialog Types]({%slug radfilepathpicker-dialog-types%}) article.

* __RoutedUI commands__: Check the [Commands]({%slug radfilepathpicker-commands%}) article for more information on the exposed commands. 

* __IconTemplateSelector__: The [IconTemplateSelector]({%slug radfilepathpicker-icontemplateselector%}) allows you to easily change the displayed icon depending on the __FilePath__.

* __Enhanced Routed Events Framework__: The events system of the control will help your code become even more elegant and concise.
