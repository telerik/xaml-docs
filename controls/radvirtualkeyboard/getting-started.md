There is no need to manually subscribe an input element to the keyboard control. When you click a key on the VirtualKeyboard, a key press message is send to the OS. In addition to this, the control is unfocusable which means that if you focus a text input (like `TextBox` for example), the focus will stay there while you press the keys.
