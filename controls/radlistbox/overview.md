## Key Features:

* __Selection__: RadListBox provides three selection modes - Single, Multiple and Extended. Read more about this in the [Selection]({%slug radlistbox-features-selection%}) article.

* __AutoComplete__: When the control is focused, the first matching item is selected while the user is typing. Read more about this in the [Autocomplete]({%slug radlistbox-features-autocomplete%}) article.

* __Drag and Drop__: Take advantage of the built-in drag and drop support to reorder items or move them from one RadListBox to another. Read more about this in the [Drag and Drop]({%slug radlistbox-features-dragdrop%}) section.

* __Keyboard Support__: RadListBox supports several keyboard shortcuts for performing the most common task. Read more about this in the [Keyboard Support]({%slug radlistbox-features-keyboard-support%}) article.

* __Theming__: As any other control from the UI for {{ site.framework_name }} suite, RadListBox comes with different themes. Read more about this in the [Styling and Appearance]({%slug styling-apperance-implicit-styles-overview%}) section of the documentation. 

>caution  If you are using [NoXaml binaries]({%slug implicit-styles-styling-the-controls%}), and you have custom Style targeting RadListBoxItem, you have to base the style on the default one of the control. Example 1 demonstrates this approach. __Example 1__ demonstrate this approach.

#### __[C#] Example 1: Implicit Style with BasedOn property set__
