# Selection


There are a couple of events relevant to the selection in RadGridView: [SelectionChanging](#selectionchanging-event), [SelectionChanged](#selectionchanged-event), [CurrentCellChanged](#currentcellchanged-event), [SelectedCellsChanging](#selectedcellschanging-event) and [SelectedCellsChanged](#selectedcellschanged-event). The sequence of the events depends on the __SelectionUnit__ property:

* __FullRow__ - the __SelectionChanged__ is fired first and after that the __CurrentCellChanged__ event fires 

* __Cell__ - the __SelectedCellsChanged__ is fired first and after that the __CurrentCellChanged__ event fires

The events are fired by RadGridView each time there is a modification of the __SelectedItems__ / __SelectedCells__ collection, regardless of the way it happened (by user input or programmatically). 

## SelectionChanging event

It is fired once a selection is about to be performed and a change in the SelectedItems collection is to be executed (a row is to be selected or un-selected and SelectionUnit="FullRow").

#### __C#__

{{region cs-gridview-selection-events_0}}

	public BasicSelection()
	{
	    InitializeComponent();
	    this.radGridView.SelectionChanging += this.SelectionChanging;
	}
	private void SelectionChanging(object sender, SelectionChangingEventArgs e )
	{ 
	}
{{endregion}}


#### __VB.NET__

{{region vb-gridview-selection-events_1}}

	Public Sub New()
	 InitializeComponent()
	 AddHandler Me.radGridView.SelectionChanging, AddressOf Me.SelectionChanging
	End Sub
	Private Sub SelectionChanging(sender As Object, e As SelectionChangingEventArgs)
	End Sub
{{endregion}}


__SelectionChangingEventArgs__ exposes the following specific properties:__AddedItems__ - a collection of the item(s) that has/have been added to the selection. __RemovedItems__ - a collection of the item(s) that has/have been removed from the selection. __IsCancelable__ - gets a value that indicates whether the event is cancelable. __Cancel__ - a boolean property that enables canceling the selection. 

## SelectionChanged event

Fires each time there is a change in the __SelectedItems__ collection (a row has been selected or un-selected and SelectionUnit="FullRow").

#### __C#__

{{region cs-gridview-selection-events_2}}

	public BasicSelection()
	{
	    InitializeComponent();
	    this.radGridView.SelectionChanged += this.SelectionChanged;
	}
	private void SelectionChanged(object sender, SelectionChangeEventArgs e )
	{
	}
{{endregion}}


#### __VB.NET__

{{region vb-gridview-selection-events_3}}

	Public Sub New()
	    InitializeComponent()
	    AddHandler Me.radGridView.SelectionChanged, AddressOf Me.SelectionChanged
	End Sub
	Private Sub SelectionChanged(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As SelectionChangeEventArgs)
	End Sub
{{endregion}}


The __SelectionChangeEventArgs__ class exposes the following specific properties:

* __AddedItems__ - a collection of the item(s) that has/have been added to the selection

* __RemovedItems__ - a collection of the item(s) that has/have been removed from the selection

## CurrentCellChanged event

This event is raised when a cell is selected. It fires before the __SelectionChanged__ (when SelectionUnit="FullRow") or before the __SelectedCellsChanged__ (when SelectionUnit="Cell").

#### __C#__

{{region cs-gridview-selection-events_4}}

	public BasicSelection()
	{
	    InitializeComponent();
	    this.radGridView.CurrentCellChanged += this.CurrentCellChanged;
	}
	private void CurrentCellChanged( object sender, GridViewCurrentCellChangedEventArgs e )
	{
	}
{{endregion}}


#### __VB.NET__

{{region vb-gridview-selection-events_5}}

	Public Sub New()
	    InitializeComponent()
	    AddHandler Me.radGridView.CurrentCellChanged, AddressOf Me.CurrentCellChanged
	End Sub
	Private Sub CurrentCellChanged(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As GridViewCurrentCellChangedEventArgs)
	End Sub
{{endregion}}


The __GridViewCurrentCellChangedEventArgs__ class exposes the following specific properties:

* __NewCell__ - an instance of the newly selected cell

* __OldCell__ - an instance of the previously selected cell

## SelectedCellsChanging event

This event is fired on the time a change in the SelectedCells collection is about to be performed (a cell is to be selected or un-selected when the SelectionUnit="Cell").

#### __C#__

{{region cs-gridview-selection-events_6}}

	public BasicSelection()
	{
	  InitializeComponent();
	  this.radGridView.SelectedCellsChanging += this.SelectedCellsChanging;
	}
	private void SelectedCellsChanging(object sender, GridViewSelectedCellsChangingEventArgse )
	{ 
	}
{{endregion}}


#### __VB.NET__

{{region vb-gridview-selection-events_7}}

	Public Sub New()
	 InitializeComponent()
	 AddHandler Me.radGridView.SelectedCellsChanging, AddressOf Me.SelectedCellsChanging
	End Sub
	Private Sub SelectedCellsChanging(sender As Object, e As GridViewSelectedCellsChangingEventArgse 
	End Sub
{{endregion}}


The __GridViewSelectedCellsChangingEventArgs__ class exposes the following specific properties:

* __AddedCells__ - a collection of the cell(s) that has/have been added to the selection

* __RemovedCells__ - a collection of the cell(s) that has/have been removed from the selection

* __IsCancelable__ - gets a value that indicates whether the event is cancelable

* __Cancel__ - a boolean property that enables canceling the cell selection

## SelectedCellsChanged event

Fires each time there is change in the __SelectedCells__ collection (a cell has been selected or un-selected when the SelectionUnit="Cell").

#### __C#__

{{region cs-gridview-selection-events_8}}

	public MainPage()
	{
	 InitializeComponent();
	 this.gridView.SelectedCellsChanged += new EventHandler<GridViewSelectedCellsChangedEventArgs>(gridView_SelectedCellsChanged);
	}
	private void gridView_SelectedCellsChanged(object sender, GridViewSelectedCellsChangedEventArgs e)
	{
	}
{{endregion}}

#### __VB.NET__

{{region vb-gridview-selection-events_9}}

	Public Sub New()
	 InitializeComponent()
	 AddHandler Me.gridView.SelectedCellsChanged, AddressOf gridView_SelectedCellsChanged
	End Sub 
	
	Private Sub gridView_SelectedCellsChanged(sender As Object, e As GridViewSelectedCellsChangedEventArgs)
	End Sub
{{endregion}}

The __GridViewSelectedCellsChangedEventArgs__ class exposes the following specific properties:

* __AddedCells__ - a collection of the cell(s) that has/have been added to the selection

* __RemovedCells__ - a collection of the cell(s) that has/have been removed from the selection
