* __Header__: This is the header control of a RadPane. In most cases it displays textual information. To learn how to customize the header, take a look at the [Styling the Pane Header]({%slug raddocking-styling-the-pane-header%}) and [How to Add Buttons to the Pane Header]({%slug raddocking-how-to-add-buttons-to-the-pane-headers%}) articles.

* __Menu__: This menu is created automatically for you and contains the __RadPane__'s most common commands. It allows you to make it floating, docked, part of a tabbed document or just hide it. The menu commands are programmatically accessible via the __RadPane__'s property __MenuCommands__. To learn how to customize this menu, take a look at the [How to Customize or Remove the RadPane's Menu]({%slug raddocking-how-to-add-menu-items-to-the-radpanes-menu%}) and [RadDocking Localization]({%slug raddocking-localization%}) articles.

* __Pin/Unpin Button__: This button allows you to pin and unpin the RadPane in case it is docked inside of the __RadSplitContainer__. It is visible by default but if you want to hide it, and prevent the user from changing the pin state of your pane, just set the pane's __CanUserPin__ property to __False__ and the button will be hidden.

* __Close button__: This button allows you to close the __RadPane__. It is visible by default but if you want to hide it, and prevent the user from closing your pane, just set the __RadPane__'s property __CanUserClose__ to __False__ and the button will be hidden. You can also have a look at the [How to Disable the Close Button]({%slug raddocking-how-to-disable-the-close-button%}) topic.

* __Tab__: The tab is visible only when a __RadPane__ is docked inside of a container that hosts more than one pane. In that case each RadPane is placed as a separate tab item. To learn more, take a look at the [Pane Groups]({%slug raddocking-features-pane-groups%}) article.
