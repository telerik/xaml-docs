# {{ site.framework_name }} RadCloudUpload RadCloudUploadListItem

The __RadCloudUploadListItem__ is part of the __RadCloudUpload__ control. It visualizes the progress and the state of the uploaded file. It has few built-in buttons in its template, such as __Upload__, __Cancel__ and __Close__. They control the uploading process.

>While a file is uploading the __Upload__ button will be collapsed or replaced by the __Cancel__ button.

This is a visual control presenting a file upload and it contains no cloud-upload logic. All upload-related tasks like progress-tracking and cancellation are handled by a [Provider]({%slug radcloudupload-features-providers%}).         

## Buttons

The __RadCloudUploadListItem__ control has several buttons in its template. By default the only button that is visible is the __Close__ button. You can use the __Buttons__ property to specify which of the available ones to be shown. This property is a flags enum of type __CloudUploadListItemCommandButtons__. __Example 1__ demonstrates how to set the property using an implicit style in XAML.

#### __[XAML] Example 1: Setting the Buttons property using an implicit style__
{{region radcloudupload-radclouduploadlistitem-0}}
    <Style TargetType="telerik:RadCloudUploadListItem">
       <Setter Property="Buttons" Value="Upload,Cancel,Close" />
    </Style>
{{endregion}}

> This property only toggles the buttons' visibility. It does not control the order of appearance. If you want to reorder the buttons, or add a custom ones you need to retemplate the control.
