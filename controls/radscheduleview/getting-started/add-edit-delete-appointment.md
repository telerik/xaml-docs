# Understanding Appointments

The __Appointment__ class represents a single piece of data that is visualized in the __RadScheduleView__. Each __Appointment__ has various properties such as __Subject, Start, End, TimeZone__, etc. You can also assign to the appointments [Resources]({%slug radscheduleview-features-resources%}), [Categories]({%slug radscheduleview-features-categories%}) and [TimeMarkers]({%slug radscheduleview-features-timemarkers%}). 

Additionally RadScheduleView provides the functionality to configure [repeating appointments]({%slug radscheduleview-features-recurrences-overview%}). The user has the ability to apply recurring scheduling patterns such as daily, weekly, monthly or set a range of recurrence from date to date.
