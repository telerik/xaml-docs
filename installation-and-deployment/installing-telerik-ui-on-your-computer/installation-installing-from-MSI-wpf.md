# Installing UI for WPF from MSI File

The following topic describes what steps you should perform in order to install Telerik UI for WPF from a __MSI__ file. 

The [MSI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Installer) files are intended for easy and automatic installation of a product. The MSI installs the suite on your computer to a folder named Telerik in your Program Files, automatically creating the necessary virtual folders and projects.

For more information about which installation package you need to install, read [here]({%slug installation-installing-which-file-do-i-need%}).

For more information about the system requirements, read [here]({%slug installation-system-requirements-wpf%}).

>tipThe latest package available for download already has all updates/HOTFIXES applied. There is no need to update it further.

>tipThe MSI installation __will not overwrite__ previous Telerik UI for WPF installations, unless it is of the same version.

Before installing Telerik UI for WPF on your machine, you need to download the latest MSI package.

## Downloading MSI Package

In order to download the latest MSI file, follow the instructions below:

* Log into your [Telerik account](http://www.telerik.com/account.aspx).

* Click __Products & Subscriptions__ and then select UI for WPF from the dropdown (or Trial downloads if you are a trial user).![Common Installing FromMSIFiles 005 WPF](images/Common_InstallingFromMSIFiles_005_WPF.png)

## Exploring the Installation Folder

If you open the installation folder ( __C:\Program Files\Telerik\UI for WPF [version]__ ) you will probably note the following sub directories:

* __Binaries__ - the standard binaries.

* __Binaries.NoXaml__ - binaries without XAML.

* __LicenseAgreements__

* __Themes.Implicit__ - implicit styles friendly XAML.
          

* __VSExtensions__

>importantWith the Q1 2014 release we no longer provide the Themes and pdb files within the installation package. You could download them separately from the UI for WPF download page in your [Telerik account](http://www.telerik.com/account.aspx).

>The WPF Demos application can be downloaded from the UI for WPF download page (in the [Telerik account](http://www.telerik.com/account.aspx)) as a separate ZIP file as well.
