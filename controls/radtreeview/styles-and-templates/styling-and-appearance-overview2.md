# Overview

This section is intended to give you a broad understanding of the possible ways by which you can change the visual appearance of the __RadTreeView__ and the __RadTreeViewItem__ . There is also comprehensive information about their __ControlTemplates__. You will need this information if you want to customize their appearance.

You can modify the look of the __RadTreeView__ and the __RadTreeViewItem__ either by changing some of the resources exposed by the __API__, or by modifying their __ControlTemplates__. In the control template you are allowed to reorder the template parts and add your own elements. However, when changing the control template you should be careful to include all required parts. 

>Note that when changing the ControlTemplate you should include all required parts. Even if your code compiles, some of the functionality may be subject to impact due to the omission of the required parts. The required parts are usually marked with the prefix "__PART___".
