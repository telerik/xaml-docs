# Localization

The built-in localization mechanism in {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %} allows you to localize any string resource used by __RadPivotGrid__ and __RadPivotFieldList__ controls. Once translated you might use the resources in your projects without changing anything. You can find more information on the localization of the RadControls {% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}[here](http://www.telerik.com/help/wpf/common-localization.html){% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}[here](http://www.telerik.com/help/silverlight/common-localization.html){% endif %}.      

>The __LocalDataSourceProvider__ provides an additional __Culture__ support option which allows you to localize the underlying data using any desired Culture. For more details please check the [Culture Support]({%slug radpivotgrid-features-culture-support%}) article from the __LocalDataSourceProvider__ section.        

## Localization Using Custom Localization Manager

__Telerik.Windows.Controls.LocalizationManager__ allows you to easily localize any of the Telerik controls. To apply custom localization to your controls just instantiate your custom LocalizationManager and set it to the static property LocalizationManager.Manager, before the creation of the UI:        

#### __C#__

{{region radpivotgrid-features-localization_1}}
	LocalizationManager.Manager = new CustomLocalizationManager();
	InitializeComponent();
{{endregion}}

#### __VB.NET__

{{region radpivotgrid-features-localization_1}}
	LocalizationManager.Manager = New CustomLocalizationManager()
	InitializeComponent()
{{endregion}}

*CustomLocalizationManager* must inherit __LocalizationManager__ and override its *GetStringOverride* method. Here is an implementation of a custom localization:

As you can see, there are a lot of keys that have to be localized. In the table below you can find more information about each of them.        

>In the code above there are two keys, that will reflect not only __RadPivotGrid__, but all buttons in your applications. These are the resources with keys "Ok" and "Cancel".
            
Key	|	English Value of the Key	|	Comment
---	|	---	|	---
Pivot_AggregateAverage	|	Average	|	Average aggregate function. Example: Average of Quantity 
Pivot_AggregateCount	|	Count	|	Count aggregate function. Example: Count of Products 
Pivot_AggregateMax	|	Max	|	Max aggregate function. Example: Max of Net 
Pivot_AggregateMin	|	Min	|	Min aggregate function. Example: Min of Net 
Pivot_AggregateProduct	|	Product	|	Product aggregate function. Example: Product of Quantity 
Pivot_AggregateStdDev	|	StdDev	|	Sample Standard Deviation aggregate function. Example: StdDev of Net 
Pivot_AggregateStdDevP	|	StdDevP	|	Population Standard Deviation aggregate function. Example: StdDevP of Net 
Pivot_AggregateSum	|	Sum	|	Sum aggregate function. Example: Sum of Net 
Pivot_AggregateVar	|	Var	|	Simple Variance aggregate function. Example: Var of Net 
Pivot_AggregateVarP	|	VarP	|	Population Variance aggregate function. Example: VarP of Net 
Pivot_AggregateP0ofP1	|	{0} of {1}	|	When you apply aggregate function for a specific property, RadPivotGrid and RadPivotFieldList show similar string: Sum of Quantity. This key will help you to localize such strings and particularly the "of" part. In the common scenario you should have {0} to show the aggregate function, your string that will replace the "of" part and {1} for property name.
Pivot_Column	|	Column	|	Used in tooltip to mark the Column in which is the current value.
Pivot_GrandTotal	|	Grand Total	|	Used in RadPivotGrid as the header of the row/column showing the Grand Totals of the aggregation.
Pivot_GroupP0AggregateP1	|	{0} {1}	|	Used in RadPivotGrid as header of the rows/columns, which is showing SubTotal when there are more than one aggregate description. {0} parameter is replaced by items name, while {1} parameter is replaced by Pivot_AggregateP0ofP1 value. Example: For the {0}='Copy Holder' group, the aggregated {1}='Sum of Quantity' it will format the aggregate group name as Copy Holder Sum of Quantity
Pivot_P0Total	|	{0} Total	|	Used in RadPivotGrid as header of the row/column, which is showing SubTotals. The {0} parameter is replaced by group name. Example: Newspaper Total
Pivot_Row	|	Row	|	Used in tooltip to mark the Row in which is the current value.
Pivot_TotalP0	|	Total {0}	|	Used in RadPivotGrid as header of the row/column, which is showing the Totals for each of the aggregate description when there are more than one. If AggregatesPosition property of RadPivotGrid is set to "Rows", than the last rows in RadPivotGrid will show the "Totals" for each of the aggregate descriptions. The headers of these last rows can be modified with this key. {0} is replaced by Pivot_AggregateP0ofP1 value. Example: Total Sum of Quantity 
Pivot_Value	|	Value: {0}	|	Used in tooltip to mark the Value of the current cell.
