# Change the Size of the RadUpload

Typically the size of a control is changed by setting its Width and Height properties, but as the __RadUpload__ has its dimensions limited by the __MaxHeight__, __MinHeight__ and __MinWidth__ properties, you have to modify them too in order to change the size of the controls. Here are the default values for these three properties:

* __MaxHeight__ - 300

* __MinHeight__ - 175

* __MinWidth__ - 350

If the size you need is in this range you don't have to set these properties explicitly.
