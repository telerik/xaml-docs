# Overview

A row is the UI representation that wraps an object form the __ItemsSource__ of the __RadGridView__. The most commonly used class is the __GridViewRow__. There are also additional row classes that are used for more specific tasks, such as the __GridViewGroupRow__, which allows expanding and collapsing the items that belong to it. There are also rows that serve as a static containers  - the __GridViewHeaderRow__ and the __GridViewFooterRow__.

## Customizing Rows

The __RadGridView__ allows you to easily style the rows by exposing a style property for each of them. To learn more about styling the different rows read [here]({%slug gridview-customizing-rows%}).

## Adding New Rows

The build-in mechanism for adding new rows allows you to easily insert data entries into your __RadGridView.__ To learn more on that topic read [here]({%slug gridview-rows-adding-rows%}).

## Details View

There are cases when you don't want to display the whole information that an object provides in a single row. The __RadGridView__ allows you to define a details view, which can hold additional information provided by the row data item and is displayed only when the row is selected. To learn more on that topic read [here]({%slug radgridview-row-details-overview%}).
