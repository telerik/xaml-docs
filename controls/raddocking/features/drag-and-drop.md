# {{ site.framework_name }} RadDocking Drag and Drop

The __Drag and Drop__ compatibilities of the __RadDocking__ control allow you to re-arange the panes in a complete __WYSIWYG__ manner. When the process of dragging starts, the [Compass]({%slug raddocking-features-compass%}) menu appears to help you dock/undock your panes. 

Below you can find several step-by-step tutorials for the most common operations that can be accomplished via drag and drop.

>tipFind out how to implement [conditional docking]({%slug raddocking-how-to-implement-conditional-docking%}) using __PreviewShowCompass__ event exposed by __RadDocking__.

## Docking Panes to a Container

1. Click on the pane's header and start dragging it to the container you wish to dock your pane to. 

1. As soon as your mouse enters a container, the __Compass__ appears right in its middle. 

1. While keeping the mouse button down, position your mouse cursor over the __compass indicator__ that points to the area you wish to dock your pane to. Notice how the possible Dropping Area is highlighted. 

1. Drop the pane and see how it is docked in the highlighted area.

As you can see you have dragged your pane over the Compass' right indicator which leads to highlighting the respective dropping area inside the underlying container.

>Note that the [Compass](#Compass) menu always marks the possible [docking](#Docking_Panes) positions within the container your mouse cursor is currently over.

## Docking Panes to the Root Container

## Adding Panes to Tabbed Documents

1. Click on the pane's header and start dragging it to the container you wish to dock your pane to. 

1. As soon as your mouse enters a container, the __Compass__ appears right in its middle.

## Undocking Panes

>tipTo undock a pane and make it floatable, just drag it out of its current place and drop it outside any compass indicator.

## Use Native ToolWindow Drag

As of **R1 2020 SP1**, the RadDocking control exposes a **UseNativeInitialToolWindowDrag** property through which you can set to **True** to use the native Windows drag operation when first undocking a pane/group. This is useful if you wish to be able to use the [Windows Snap Assist feature](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027324/windows-10-snap-your-windows) or take into account the "Show window contents while dragging" Windows setting.

#### __[XAML] Example 1: Enable Native ToolWindow Drag__

	<telerik:RadDocking x:Name="radDocking" UseNativeInitialToolWindowDrag="True">
		<!-- ... -->
