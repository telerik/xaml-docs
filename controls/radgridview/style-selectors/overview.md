## What is a Style Selector?

The __StyleSelector__ provides a way to apply styles based on custom logic.
		
Typically, you use a style selector when you have more than one styles defined for the same type of objects. For example, use it if your binding source is a list of student objects and you want to apply a particular style to the part-time students. You can do this by creating a class that inherits from the __StyleSelector__ class and by overriding its __SelectStyle()__ method. Once your class is defined you can assign an instance of the class to the style selector property of your element.
