# {{ site.framework_name }} RadMenu Commands

The __RadMenuItem__ control provides you with a standard __ICommandSource__ implementation. This means that you can bind your items to commands that will get executed when an item is clicked. For this purpose you can use the following properties.

* __Command__ - gets the command that will be executed when the command source is invoked. 

* __CommandParameter__ - represents a user defined data value that can be passed to the command when it is executed.  

* __CommandTarget__ - the object that the command is being executed on.  

>tipAs the __RadMenuItem__ implements the __ICommandSource__, you can use it with any command that implements the __ICommand__ interface, for example the __DelegateCommands__ in Prism.

> By default the command of a RadMenuItem will not be executed for RadMenuItems which have child RadMenuItems. If you wish to change this behavior, you can set the __NotifyOnHeaderClick__ property of the __RadMenu__ to __True__. This way, even if a RadMenuItem has child items, its corresponding command will be invoked on click.
