# Visual Structure

This section defines terms and concepts used in the scope of __RadTreeView__ you have to get familiar with prior to continue reading this help.

__RadTreeView__ is a powerful control which lets you create complicated navigation systems and display hierarchical structures, such as directories and relational data. Below you can see a snapshot and explanation of the main visual elements of the standard __RadTreeView__ control.

The structure of a __RadTreeView__ is pretty simple. It consists of the following main elements:

* __TreeView Items (Nodes) - RadTreeView__ control provides a way to display information in a hierarchical structure by using collapsible items (nodes). Each TreeView item is an instance of the __RadTreeViewItem__ class. You can navigate between these items using either your mouse device or your keyboard.

* __Expander__ - the expander is used to expand or collapse the TreeView items. You can easily style it to provide better user experience. [Read more]({%slug radtreeview-styling-and-appearance-styling-expander%})

* __Check Boxes (Radio Buttons)__ - check Boxes (Radio Buttons) are displayed in front of the nodes' text. To show them you should set the __ItemsOptionsListType__ to __CheckList__ (or __OptionList__ for Radio Buttons). The TreeView nodes support "tri-state" checkboxes.

* __Lines__ - connecting lines between the nodes. You can easily show/hide the connecting lines. You should use a single property to do so - __IsLineEnabled__. [Read more]({%slug check-box-support%})

* __Item Images__ - item images are displayed in front of the nodes' text (check boxes - if they are shown). __RadTreeView__ gives you the ability to define images for each item state. [Read more]({%slug radtreeview-feautres-treeviewitem-item-images%})
