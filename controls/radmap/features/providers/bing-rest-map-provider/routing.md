# {{ site.framework_name }} RadMap Routing

RadMap provides a unified route search architecture which uses the functionality of the different routing services. This allows you to calculate a route between different locations on the map. You can access the routing service via __BingRestMapProvider__ provider. 

>The BingRestMapProvider's built-in routing service wraps the [Routes API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff701705.aspx) of the Bing Maps Rest services.

## Set up routing request and events

In order to get the routing data you can create instance of the __BingRestRouteRequest__ object. Then you can call the __CalculateRouteAsync()__ method of the __BingRestMapProvider__ which uses the request object as a parameter. Then you can subscribe to the BingRestMapProvider's __CalculateRouteCompleted__ and __CalculateRouteError__ event. You can take a look at the following steps:

* Set the __ApplicationId__ property of the __BingRestMapProvider__. This property represents a key, which allows you to use the Bing Rest Maps services.

	>Without supplying a valid key you won't be able to visualize the map inside the RadMap control. In order to learn how to obtain one, please read [Accessing the Control Using a Bing Maps](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee681900.aspx).
	
* Create instance of the __BingRestRouteRequest__ object
* Handle __CalculateRouteCompleted__ and __CalculateRouteError__ events of the __BingRestMapProvider__
* Call __CalculateRouteAsync()__ method of the __BingRestRouteRequest__ and provide the request as a parameter

The __BingRestRouteRequest__ object provides __Options__ property of type __BingRestRouteOptions__ which allow the user to customize it. The following list represents this options:
 
* __Mode__: A property of type __BingRestTravelMode__ that gets or sets the type of direction. This mode is enumeration and it allows the following values.
	* __Driving__: The return route contains driving directions 
	* __Walking__: The return route contains walking directions
* __Optimization__: A property of type __BingRestRouteOptimization__ that gets or sets the calculation method that will use. This optimization is enumeration and it allows the following values.
	* __Distance__: The route is calculated to minimize the total distance. __Traffic information is not used.__
	* __Time__: The route is calculated to minimize the total time. __Traffic information is not used.__
	* __TimeWithTraffic__: The route is calculated to minimize the time and uses current traffic information.
	* __TimeAvoidClosure__: The route is calculated to minimize the time and avoid road closures. __Traffic information is not used.__
* __RouteAvoidance__: A property of type __BingRestRouteAvoidance__ that gets or sets the calculation method that will use. These route attributes are enumerations and it allows the following values.
	* __None__: Use all roads.
	* __Highways__: Avoids the use of highways in the route.
	* __Tolls__: Avoids the use of toll roads in the route.
	* __MinimizeHighways__: Minimizes (tries to avoid) the use of highways in the route.
	* __MinimizeTolls__: Minimizes (tries to avoid) the use of toll roads in the route.       
* __RouteAttributes__: A property of type __BingRestRouteAttributes__ that gets or sets whether to include or exclude parts of the routes response. The default value is BingRestRouteAttributes.ExcludeItinerary. This optimization is enumeration and it allows the following values.
	* __ExcludeItinerary__: Use all roads.
	* __RoutePath__: Avoids the use of highways in the route.
	* __TransitStops__: Avoids the use of toll roads in the route.
	* __All__: Minimizes __(tries to avoid)__ the use of highways in the route.
	* __RouteSummariesOnly__: Minimizes __(tries to avoid)__ the use of toll roads in the route.

#### __[C#] Example 2: Defining BingRestRouteRequest object__
{{region cs-radmap-features-providers-bing-rest-map-provider-search-location_1}}	
		private LocationCollection wayPoints = new LocationCollection();
        public BingRestRouteRequest request { get; set; }
        public MainWindow()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
            this.wayPointsLayer.ItemsSource = this.wayPoints;
            request = new BingRestRouteRequest();  
            this.restProvider.CalculateRouteAsync(request);
        }		
		private void BingRestMapProvider_CalculateRouteCompleted(object sender, BingRestRoutingCompletedEventArgs e)
        {     
        }		
        private void BingRestMapProvider_CalculateRouteError(object sender, BingRestCalculateRouteErrorEventArgs e)
        {
            MessageBox.Show(e.Error.ToString());
        }
{{endregion}}

#### __[VB.NET] Example 2: Defining BingRestRouteRequest object__
{{region vb-radmap-features-providers-bing-rest-map-provider-search-location_2}}	
	Private wayPoints As New LocationCollection()
	Private request As BingRestRouteRequest
	Public Sub New()
		InitializeComponent()
		Me.wayPointsLayer.ItemsSource = Me.wayPoints
		request = New BingRestRouteRequest()
		request.Options.RouteAttributes = BingRestRouteAttributes.RoutePath
		Me.restProvider.CalculateRouteAsync(request)
	End Sub

	Private Sub BingRestMapProvider_CalculateRouteCompleted(sender As Object, e As BingRestRoutingCompletedEventArgs)
	
	End Sub
	Private Sub BingRestMapProvider_CalculateRouteError(sender As Object, e As BingRestCalculateRouteErrorEventArgs)
		MessageBox.Show(e.Error.ToString)
	End Sub
{{endregion}}
	
## Executing Routing
	
In order to execute a routing action you have to call the __CalculateRouteAsync()__ method of the __BingRestMapProvider__ and pass a __BingRestRouteRequest__ object as its argument. The __BingRestRouteRequest__ should contain the points which should take part in the desired order. To pass the location points to the request argument just use its __Waypoints__ property.
	
#### __[C#] Example 4: Calling the CalculateRouteAsync() methods__
{{region cs-radmap-features-providers-bing-rest-map-provider-search-location_3}}	
	 private LocationCollection wayPoints = new LocationCollection();
        public BingRestRouteRequest request { get; set; }
        public MainWindow()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
            this.wayPointsLayer.ItemsSource = this.wayPoints;
            request = new BingRestRouteRequest();
            wayPoints.Add(new Location(52.5629950395581, 13.359375));
            wayPoints.Add(new Location(48.835797462431, 2.2412109375));            
            request.Options.RouteAttributes = BingRestRouteAttributes.RoutePath;
            foreach (var point in wayPoints)
            {
                request.Waypoints.Add(point.ToString());
            }
            this.restProvider.CalculateRouteAsync(request);
        }
{{endregion}}

#### __[VB.NET] Example 4: Calling the CalculateRouteAsync() methods__
{{region vb-radmap-features-providers-bing-rest-map-provider-search-location_4}}	
	Private wayPoints As New LocationCollection()
    Private request As BingRestRouteRequest
    Public Sub New()
        InitializeComponent()
        Me.wayPointsLayer.ItemsSource = Me.wayPoints
        request = New BingRestRouteRequest()
        request.Options.RouteAttributes = BingRestRouteAttributes.RoutePath
        wayPoints.Add(New Location(52.5629950395581, 13.359375))
        wayPoints.Add(New Location(48.835797462431, 2.2412109375))
        For Each point In wayPoints
            request.Waypoints.Add(point.ToString)
        Next
        Me.restProvider.CalculateRouteAsync(request)
    End Sub

    Private Sub BingRestMapProvider_CalculateRouteCompleted(sender As Object, e As BingRestRoutingCompletedEventArgs)

    Private Sub BingRestMapProvider_CalculateRouteError(sender As Object, e As BingRestCalculateRouteErrorEventArgs)
        MessageBox.Show(e.Error.ToString)
    End Sub

## Routing Result	
	
The result from the routing services is held by the Route object inside the __BingRestRoutingCompletedEventArgs__ of the handler for the __CalculateRouteCompleted__ event.
		
To get the result you have to access the Points collection of the __Telerik.Windows.Controls.DataVisualization.Map.BingRest.RoutePath__ object. In __Example 5__ the result is displayed by a PolylineData via the RadMap's visualization layer.	

#### __[C#] Example 5: Handling the CalculateRouteCompleted event__
{{region cs-radmap-features-providers-bing-rest-map-provider-search-location_5}}		
	private void BingRestMapProvider_CalculateRouteCompleted(object sender, BingRestRoutingCompletedEventArgs e)
	{          
		Telerik.Windows.Controls.DataVisualization.Map.BingRest.Route route = e.Route;
		if (route != null)
		{
			PolylineData routeLine = this.CreateNewPolyline(Colors.Blue, 5);

			// Building the polyline representing the route.
			foreach (double[] coordinatePair in route.RoutePath.Line.Coordinates)
			{
				Location point = new Location(coordinatePair[0], coordinatePair[1]);
				routeLine.Points.Add(point);
			}
			this.routeLayer.Items.Add(routeLine);
			// Bringing the route into view.
			double[] bbox = e.Route.BoundingBox;
			LocationRect rect = new LocationRect(new Location(bbox[2], bbox[1]), new Location(bbox[0], bbox[3]));
			this.myMap.SetView(rect);
		}
	}
	private PolylineData CreateNewPolyline(Color color, double thickness)
	{
		PolylineData routeLine = new PolylineData()
		{
			ShapeFill = new MapShapeFill()
			{
				Stroke = new SolidColorBrush(color),
				StrokeThickness = thickness,
				StrokeDashArray = this.request.Options.Mode == BingRestTravelMode.Walking ? new DoubleCollection() { 2, 1 } : new DoubleCollection(),
			},
			Points = new LocationCollection(),
		};
		return routeLine;
