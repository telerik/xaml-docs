## Key Features

* __Editing__: The RadCardView cards contain sets of data fields that can be edited while the corresponding card is selected. Read more in the [Editing]({%slug radcardview-features-editing%}) article.

* __Selection__: The control provides a built-in selection support. Clicking on a card in the layout selects it. You can also use the selection API. Read more in the [Selection]({%slug radcardview-features-selection%}) article.

* __Grouping__: The users can interactively organize their data in a way that suits best their needs with a single drag and drop action. Data can be grouped according to several criteria effectively creating a tree of groups with the leaf nodes holding the actual data records. Users can group data by dragging a data field from the drop down menu and dropping it in the group area. Additionally, you can group the data programmatically using the GroupDescriptors collection of the corresponding [collection view]({%slug consuming-data-queryablecollectionview%}). Read more in the [Grouping]({%slug radcardview-features-grouping%}) article.

* __Sorting__: RadCardView allows you to sort the cards via the [drop down menu]({%slug radcardview-visual-structure%}) listing the data fields. Read more in the [Sorting]({%slug radcardview-features-sorting%}) article.

* __Filtering__: The control has built-in filtering support. Read more in the [Filtering]({%slug radcardview-features-filtering%}) article.

* __Different card layouts__: The layout of the cards and groups can be altered between row and column based ordering. Read more in the [Card Layout]({%slug radcardview-features-layout%}) article.

* __Customizeable elements__: The visualization of RadCardView's groups and cards can be easily customized using the control's API. Read more in the [Appearance]({%slug radcardview-appearance-customizing-cards%}) section of the documentation.

* __Data Validation__: The control comes with a built-in data validation feature and visual feedback for values that don't match the validation criteria. Read more in the [Data Validation]({%slug radcardview-features-validation%}) article.

* __Localization support__: The text used in the settings areas of the controls is localized. Read more about the Telerik Localization support in the [Localization]({%slug radcardview-features-localization%}) article which lists also the supported languages.

* __UI Virtualization__: RadCardView item containers are virtualized which means that only the containers visible in the viewport are generated, thus boosting the performance.
