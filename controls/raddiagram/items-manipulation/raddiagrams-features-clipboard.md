# {{ site.framework_name }} RadDiagram Clipboard Operations

__RadDiagram__ gives you the ability to __Cut__, __Copy__ and __Paste__ RadDiagramItems within an application or from __WPF__ to __Silverlight 5__ application and vice versa.	  

>Please note that the examples in this tutorial are showcasing Telerik Windows8 theme. In the {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}[Setting a Theme](http://www.telerik.com/help/silverlight/common-styling-apperance-setting-theme.html#Setting_Application-Wide_Built-In_Theme_in_the_Code-Behind){% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}[Setting a Theme](http://www.telerik.com/help/wpf/common-styling-apperance-setting-theme-wpf.html#Setting_Application-Wide_Built-In_Theme_in_the_Code-Behind){% endif %} article you can find more information on how to set an application-wide theme.		

## AllowCopy, AllowCut, AllowPaste 

By default, the __AllowCopy__, __AllowCut__ and __AllowPaste__ properties are set to True but you can set then to False in order to disable these Clipboard operations.		

## Cut, Copy, Paste with Keyboard

In order to Cut, Copy or Paste particular RadDiagramItems you have to select them and use the standard keyboard combinations:

* __(Ctrl + C)__ -  copies the selected items.		  

* __(Ctrl + X)__ -  cuts the selected items.		  

* __(Ctrl + V)__ -  pastes the selected items.		  

You can perform these operations in a single WPF or SL 5 application but you can also copy/cut and paste items from WPF to SL 5 and vice versa.

Below you can see three shapes copied from SL 5 application and pasted in WPF 4 application: ![raddiagram-clipboardoperations](images/raddiagram-clipboardoperations.png)

## Cut, Copy, Paste with DiagramCommands

You can use the DiagramCommands "__Cut__", "__Copy__" and "__Paste__" in order to perform the standard clipboard operations.		

For more information on this, please check out the [Commands article]({%slug raddiagrams-features-commands%}).		

## Copy Shapes from Visio, MSOffice and more...

With the Q3 2012 release, we introduced a built-in feature in the __Diagramming__ framework, that allows you to copy shapes from __Visio__ and paste them directly onto the Diagramming surface. 		

>Please have in mind that the true Visio XML format pasted on the clipboard describes an object model which has nothing in common with the __RadDiagram__ object model. This is why we implemented this feature by using an image format to read the clipboard data and paste a __RadDiagramShape__ containing the clipboard image onto the WPF __RadDiagram__ surface.		  

Furthermore, you can now copy any portion of __MicrosoftOffice__ data or part of a __Photoshop__ image and paste it directly onto the Diagramming surface. You can also copy an xml representing __RadDiagram__ elements and as soon as you paste it onto your __RadDiagram__, the elements will be deserialized and automatically generated on the surface.
