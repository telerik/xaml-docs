To support new data binding scenarios, Telerik __RadChart__ provides automated data binding to Nested Collections. 


* __Data Virtualization and Data Sampling__ - this functionality allows you to handle and visualize millions of data points in a matter of milliseconds. The control splits the data into groups and aggregates each group using one of the many provided sampling functions. The end result is a graph that summarizes the real data close enough while performing times faster. The control comes with a number of pre set sampling functions but you can also specify your own in order to achieve the most accurate chart view for your application. [Read more]({%slug radchart-features-sampling%})

* __Scrolling and Zooming__ - to make it easier to drill-down inside and navigate the entire data source we have also provided zooming and scrolling functionality and a modified __RadSlider__ to make it even more convenient to browse. [Read more]({%slug radchart-features-zooming-and-scrolling%})

* __Tooltip Support__ - Telerik __RadChart__ allows adding tooltips to your charts for better visualization of your data. The tooltips can easily show the actual numbers behind the chart or even another chart. [Read more]({%slug radchart-features-tooltips%})

Restyling __RadChart__ with the available themes is as simple as changing a single property. The added custom style properties for all major chart elements and all series facilitate using custom user styles.

* __Categorical X Axis__ - with this feature enabled X axis can be used to plot not only values (e.g. number of sales, etc.), but also categories (e.g. months of the year, units, people, etc.).

[See an example](http://demos.telerik.com/silverlight/default.aspx#Chart/MVVM)
