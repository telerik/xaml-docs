# {{ site.framework_name }} RadGridView First Row is Always Selected

__PROBLEM__

By default, the first row of the RadGridView is selected. This is also causing the [SelectionChanged]({%slug gridview-selection-events%}) event to fire when the control is loaded.

>tipThis behavior does not occur in versions after __Q2 2010__. 

__CAUSE__

Let's first start with some definitions:

* __SelectedItem__: Holds the data item (business object) of the __selected row__. 

* __CurrentItem__: Corresponds to the **CurrentItem** of the bound **ICollectionView**. It may or may not coincide with the selected row.

With versions prior to Q2 2010, the __current item was synchronized with the selected item__ by default. As a result, the __first row__ of the control was __initially selected__.

__SOLUTION__

Set the __IsSynchronizedWithCurrentItem__ property of RadGridView to __False__.

>Since Q2 2010 version the __IsSynchronizedWithCurrentItem__ is **null** by default - SelectedItem is synchronized with the CurrentItem only if a **CollectionView** is used as **ItemsSource**.
