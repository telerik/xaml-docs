# Localization



The built-in localization mechanism in {% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %} allows you to localize __RadTreeListView__ control.
      

Here is a list of the supported languages:
      

*  __English__
        

*  __German__
        

*  __Spanish__
        

*  __French__
        

>tip__To learn more about the ways in which to localize the RadControls, please read the common topic about [Localization]({%slug common-localization%}).

## Resource Keys

The __RadTreeListView__ inherits the __RadGridView__ so it shares its resource keys and does not expose any specific ones. To see a list of all resource keys and their default values read the [Localization]({%slug gridview-localization2%}) topic for the __RadGridView__.
