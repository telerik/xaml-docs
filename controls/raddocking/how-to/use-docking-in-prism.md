# {{ site.framework_name }} RadDocking How to Use RadDocking in Prism

[Prism](https://github.com/PrismLibrary) can be thought of as a set of libraries for building scalable, maintainable and testable XAML applications. It provides a number of features such as modularity, view regions and commanding. A common scenario is to use the __RadDocking__ control with Prism. The recommended approach is to declare the entire Docking control as a Prism region and add the RadPanes as region Views, after which all that is required is to create a custom RegionAdapter that would adapt the control's PanesSource to that regionâ€™s Views.

For further details, see the [Docking PRISM Implementation with MEF](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/Docking/ShellPrism) example in our SDK Repository, which demonstrates how to implement the main functionality of RadDocking using PRISM and MEF. The covered scenarios include:

 * MEF
 * MVVM
 * CustomRegionAdapter
 * CustomRegionBehavior, which helps Activation implementation
 * Activation
 * Custom Event aggregators
 * Predefined docking layout at start up
 * Save and Load docking layout on application start up and exit
 * Adding new documents at runtime

For detailed description on the implementation, see the [Using RadDocking with PRISM in WPF/Silverlight](http://www.telerik.com/blogs/using-raddocking-with-prism-in-wpf-silverlight) blog post.
