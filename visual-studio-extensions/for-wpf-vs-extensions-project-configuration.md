# Project creation and configuration



## 

With the new Visual Studio Extensions for WPF you can quickly create an application pre-configured to use Telerik UI for WPF. The fastest way to have such a project is using the Visual Studio __New Project Wizard__. Under the __Telerik__ node there is a new node – __Windows__, where four project templates exist:

For convenience the same project templates could be found under the __Visual C# -> Windows__ and __Visual Basic -> Windows__ nodes. 

After you click the __OK__ button, you get the Project Configuration Wizard, provided by the Telerik UI for WPF Visual Studio Extensions. The wizard detects all the installed distributions of UI for WPF and lists them in a combobox. You can select a distribution which you want to be applied to your project. The wizard helps you manage the references to UI for WPF that will also be added to your application. You can access the Project Configuration Wizard through the Telerik menu when you need to configure your Telerik WPF application or you need to convert an existing WPF application to a Telerik WPF application. These depend on the active project in the Visual Studio Solution Explorer: 

__Configure Telerik WPF Application__

__Convert to Telerik WPF Application__

Both menus have their context menu counterparts accessed by right clicking on the project you want to convert or configure. 

The Project Configuration Wizard lets you tune your project's use of UI for Wpf.

The Project Configuration Wizard’s first page lets you:
        

* Select a Telerik UI version from the list of versions detected on your system
          

* Navigate to a folder you’ve manually downloaded and extracted a hotfix by clicking the __Browse__ button.
          

* Download the latest versions available on our website using the __Download__ button
          

* Choose whether you want to copy the referenced assemblies to your solution folder
          

* Choose whether you want to use implicit styles or not ([more information]({%slug styling-apperance-implicit-styles-overview%}))
          

* Specify which assemblies your project would use. When selecting a UI for WPF assembly all dependent controls are selected automatically and vice-versa.
          

>The Project Configuration Wizard’s second page is only available if you choose to use theming based on implicit styles. The default UI for WPF theming mechanism does not require any special project configuration.

>The __Add referenced assemblies to solution__ option is not available when using GAC based distributions.

Through the Project Configuration Wizard’s second page you can:
        

* Select the way you want themes to be applied in your project
            

* via referencing theme assemblies
              

* via adding theme xaml files to your project
              

* Select the theme(s) you wish your to use
          

When you click the Finish button:
        

* The selected assembly references get added to your project
          

* The necessary theme xaml files get included in your project
          

* A default application-wide theme gets set if you select theming based on implicit styles. The first selected theme will be used for a default theme in case you select multiple themes
