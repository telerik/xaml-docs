# Insert and Remove Data

* [Methods](#methods)

* [Events](#events)

__RadVirtualGrid__ exposes an API for inserting and removing rows and columns at given index. This can be achieved through the following methods:

> The methods for removing a row or column cannot be utilized for pinned rows or columns.

## Methods

* __InsertNewRowAtIndex(int index)__: Increases the table capacity by adding a row at given index

* __InsertNewColumnAtIndex(int index)__: Increases the table capacity by adding a column at given index

* __RemoveRowAtIndex(int index)__: Decreases the capacity of the table by removing a row at given index

* __RemoveColumnAtIndex(int index)__: Decreases the capacity of the table by removing a column at given index

>When inserting a row or a column, the control simply increases its capacity. Updating the source collection with this modification needs to be done manually as well.

## Events
