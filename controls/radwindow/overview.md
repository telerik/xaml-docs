Thank you for choosing Telerik __RadWindow__!

With Telerik __RadWindow__ you can easily add modal popups to your application.  Draw attention to important information or receive user input. __RadWindow__ lets you create child and dialog Windows, which can have their appearance and content customized. The control provides a flexible API to easily control its behavior and makes possible the implementation of complex logic for a wide range of scenarios.

This is a list with short descriptions of the top-of-the-line features of Telerik's __RadWindow__ control.

* __Child Windows Across All Platforms__: Telerik __RadWindow__ enables you to create child windows in Silverlight, WPF and XBAP applications with the same API, functionality and appearance across all platforms. The [RadWindowManager]({%slug radwindow-features-radiwindowmanager%}) class makes it easy to control all currently open RadWindows.

* __Predefined Dialogs__: Telerik __RadWindow__ provides an easy way to replace the standard non-customizable dialog boxes (alert, confirm, and prompt) provided by the browser. With __RadWindow__ you can blend the popup into the application’s design to achieve better user experience. [Read more]({%slug radwindow-features-predefined-dialogs%})

* __Styling and Appearance__: Telerik __RadWindow__ is a fully customizable control, which lets you easily modify all its visual elements. The control comes with several built-in skins that can be customized if needed. [Read more]({%slug radwindow-styles-and-templates-overview%})

* __Configuration__: Telerik __RadWindow__ can be easily configured to suit the needs of your application. You have a full control over determining the initial [state]({%slug radwindow-features-states%}) and [position]({%slug radwindow-features-positioning%}) of the window, whether it can be [resized]({%slug radwindow-features-resizing%}), [closed]({%slug radwindow-features-closing%}) or [moved]({%slug radwindow-features-moving%}).
