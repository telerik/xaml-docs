# {{ site.framework_name }} RadDocking Not Supported Properties

There are several properties that are not supported by the __RadDocking__ control. Below is a list of these properties and the reason why they are not working. However, we are working on improving their behavior. 

## RadDocking

Properties that are __not supported__:

* __ItemsSource__

* __ItemTemplate__

* __ItemTemplateSelector__

* __ItemContainerStyle__

* __ItemContainerStyleSelector__

* __DisplayMemberPath__

__Description__: These properties are directly inherited from __ItemsControl__ property and the use of __ItemsSource__ property is __not supported__.

Properties that should __not be changed__:

* __ItemsPanel__

__Description__: The __RadDocking__ control allows its __ItemsPanel__ property to be used and customized, but this could lead to an __unexpected__ behavior of the control.

Problematical Properties:

* __FlowDirection__

__Description__: Not implemented yet. This problem will be targeted soon.

> If you want to bind a collection of objects to __RadDocking__ you could use the {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}[__PanesSource__]({%slug raddocking-features-panes-panesource%}){% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}[__PanesSource__]({%slug raddocking-features-panes-panesource%}){% endif %} property. It is very similar to the not supported __ItemsSource__ property - it can even be bound to RadPane instances.
