# Programmatic Upload

You can achieve programmatic upload by using the different methods exposed by the __RadUpload__ control. Here is a list of them:

* __CancelUpload()__ - cancels the current upload. When the upload gets canceled the __UploadCanceled__ event is raised.

* __PauseUpload()__ - pauses the current upload. When the upload gets paused the __UploadPaused__ event is raised.

* __ResumeUpload()__ - resumes the paused upload. When the upload gets resumed the __UploadResumed__ event is raised.

* __ShowFileDialog()__ - opens the browse dialog window.

* __StartUpload()__ - starts the upload. When the upload gets started the __UploadStarted__ event is raised.
