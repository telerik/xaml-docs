Elements can be bound to data from a variety of data sources in the form of common language runtime (CLR) objects and XML - see the list of the supported data sources bellow.\r\n* Value (a property of RadDataBar) - expects a value which will be used to determine the size of the bar.\r\n* ValuePath (a property of RadStackedDataBar and RadStacked100DataBar) - expects the name of the property from the underlying datasource, which will determine the value of each bar in the stack.","KeyWords":"Data Binding,  databinding, mvvm, stackeddatabar"}]
