# Templates Structure

>tipTo learn how to style Telerik UI controls, you can read the common topics about [Setting a Theme (Using Implicit Styles)]({%slug styling-apperance-implicit-styles-overview%})

Using [Implicit Styles]({%slug styling-apperance-implicit-styles-overview%}) gives you the ability to easily extract and edit the default ControlTemplates of the controls. You can follow [this article]({%slug styling-apperance-editing-control-templates%}) on two different approaches on how to extract the ControlTemplates.
