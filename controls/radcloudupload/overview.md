# Overview





## 

The __RadCouldUpload__ control can be used in scenarios when our customers need to allow their users to upload files to a cloud storage provider. This control can be configured to upload files to different storage providers.
        

This is a list with short description of the top-of-the-line features of Telerik's __RadCloudUpload__ control for WPF
        

* __Multiple Files Upload__ - to save the user’s time and efforts, __RadCloudUpload__ allows upload of several files at the same time by setting a single property through its multiple files upload feature. 

* __Styling and Appearance__ - the visual appearance of the control can be fully customized. There are also several pre-defined themes that can be used to stylize the upload control.
            

* __Automatic Upload__ - automatically upload the files right after the latter have been selected in the “Open” dialog.
