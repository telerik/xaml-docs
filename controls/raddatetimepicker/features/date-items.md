# {{ site.framework_name }} RadDateTimePicker Date Items

When you use the __RadDateTimePicker__ control you can customize the date items included in the __Calendar__ view. You can define start and end dates for the entries in the calendar. You do this using the following properties:

* __DisplayDateStart__ - it is of type __DateTime__ and represents the starting date of the date items in your __Calendar__.

* __DisplayDateEnd__ - it is again of type __DateTime__ and represents the ending date of the items in your __Calendar__.

If you specify these properties you will be able to select a date only in the range of the chosen start and end dates.

Here is an example of setting these properties in XAML:

#### __XAML__

{{region xaml-raddatetimepicker-features-date-items_0}}
	<telerik:RadDateTimePicker DisplayDateStart="1/1/2010" DisplayDateEnd="11/15/2010"/>
{{endregion}}

Here is the result:

![{{ site.framework_name }} RadDateTimePicker with DisplayDateStart and DisplayDateEnd Limitation](images/dateTimePicker_features_date_items_010.png)

The Next Month button is not active because of the __DisplayDateEnd__ property's value set in the example.

>tipYou can further restrict the input by indicating a selectable start and end dates. These dates will allow you to select only within a predefined range, but you would still have the ability to browse within the range of the display start and end dates.

## Using a default display date

You can also set the default date visible when the calendar appears. The property you have to use is called __DisplayDate__ and is of type __DateTime__. 

>Notice that the __DisplayDate__ is different from the __SelectedDate__ property. The __DisplayDate__ points out just the default month and year visible when the calendar first pops up, nothing is selected. 

For example:

#### __XAML__

{{region xaml-raddatetimepicker-features-date-items_1}}
	<telerik:RadDateTimePicker DisplayDate="4/1/2010"/>
{{endregion}}

The result of this example will be that when you click on the __RadDateTimePicker's__ drop-down button for the first time in the calendar you will not see the current month and year but instead the month and year defined in the __DisplayDate__ property.

>tipIf you set the __DisplayDate__ property to a value which is not in the range of the __DisplayDateStart__ and __DisplayDateEnd__ properties you will end up with a parse error exception.
