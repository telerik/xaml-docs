# {{ site.framework_name }} RadDiagram Tools Overview

Essentially the diagramming tools are a way of encapsulating series of related events usually triggered by an explicit action from the user. 

Let's take for example the selection of diagram items by dragging a selection rectangle. This action has three related events which always come as one and in the same chronological order - the mouse is pressed, the mouse is moved and then finally released. During this selection process you don't want to move the items or trigger any non-selection related action by the changes of the mouse. Because of this, we've designed the diagramming tools to be mutually exclusive. This means that at any moment __only one tool is active__. This logic is implemented by a __ToolService__, which manages the registered tools and switches them on or off. When a tool tells the service that it will handle the mouse events, the __ToolService__ blocks the other tools until that tool has finished its handling.
