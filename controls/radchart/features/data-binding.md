# {{ site.framework_name }} RadChart Data Binding



## 

__RadChart__ supports data binding to various data sources and services. Moreover, __RadChart__ can be used in two modes:

* [Automatic Series Mappings]({%slug radchart-populating-with-data-data-binding-with-automatic-series-binding%}) - simply set __ReadChart.ItemsSource__ and __RadChart__ will automatically create the needed series mapping. Use automatic data series mapping when you have simple data. 


* [Manual Series Mapping]({%slug radchart-populating-with-data-data-binding-with-manual-series-mapping%}) - use manual series mapping for more complex business objects or when you want more control.

For more information take a look at the [Data Binding Support Overview]({%slug radchart-populating-with-data-data-binding-support-overview%}) topic.
