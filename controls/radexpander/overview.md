__RadExpander__ is a flexible control that helps you save space and achieve an easier navigation through your site. You can place the expander anywhere on your page and embed any content inside the drop-down area. __RadExpander__ also gives you the control over its __ExpandDirection__ to let you adjust the control as per your custom layout.
