# {{ site.framework_name }} RadDesktopAlert Show on Current Screen

By default, the alerts displayed by the RadDesktopAlertManager are only shown on the primary screen.

## Attach

As of **R2 2022**, the `RadDesktopAlertManager` allows you to show alerts on the current screen on which a particular parent window instance is displayed. This can be accomplished via the new `Attach` method of the class.

#### __[C#] Attach the RadDesktopAlertManager to the MainWindow__

{{region cs-raddesktopalert-show-on-current-screen_0}}
    var manager = new RadDesktopAlertManager();
    manager.Attach(App.Current.MainWindow);
{{endregion}}

After this, if you move the `MainWindow` of the application to another screen (different than the primary), any new alerts shown via the `ShowAlert` will be displayed on this screen.

Actually, you can pass any `DependencyObject` to the Attach method and it will automatically determine the window to which the manager has to be attached.

#### __[C#] Attach the RadDesktopAlertManager to a DependencyObject__

{{region cs-raddesktopalert-show-on-current-screen_1}}
    var manager = new RadDesktopAlertManager();
    manager.Attach(this.LayoutRoot);
{{endregion}}

>If you attach the same RadDesktopAlertManager instance on a new element, any alerts which are already displayed will remain open. Alerts which are displayed on a different screen will also stay open.
>
>The screenPositionOffset parameter that is passed to the constructor of the RadDesktopAlertManager is not taken into account if the manager is attached to a particular screen.

## Detach

If you want to bring back the default behavior and show the alerts only on the primary screen, you can call the new `Detach` method of the class.

#### __[C#] Detach the RadDesktopAlertManager__

{{region cs-raddesktopalert-show-on-current-screen_1}}
    manager.Detach();
{{endregion}}

>importantDoing so will close all previously opened alerts.

>You do not need to call the Detach method if you want to attach the manager to a different element.
