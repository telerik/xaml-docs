## Key Features

The following list presents the most popular features in Telerik's __RadButtons__:

* [DropDown Button]({%slug radbuttons-features-dropdown-button%})&mdash;Provides a menu-like interface model within a button. It can be very handy for creating a more simplistic UI where extensive menus and/or ComboBoxes are not needed. Any kind of content can be placed in the pop-up area displayed upon the activation of the button.

* [Split Button]({%slug radbuttons-features-split-button%})&mdash;Extends the __DropDown Button's__ functionality with an action area like in a standard button. The Split Button implements the __IsChecked__ state too. 

* [Toggle Button]({%slug radbuttons-features-toggle-button%})&mdash;Mimics the functionality of a check box, but has more flexibility in its design. It offers state management based on the check state of the control. 

* [Toggle Switch Button]({%slug radbuttons-features-toggle-switch-button%})&mdash;Mimics the functionality of a Toggle button, but has more flexibility in its design. You can specify two states: Check/Uncheck and On/Off. Every state can be customized with different content.

* [Radio Button]({%slug radbutton-features-radio-button%})&mdash;Mimics the functionality of the radio button, but has more flexibility in its design. 

* [Speech-Text-Button]({%slug radbuttons-features-speech-to-text-button%})&mdash;This button introduces special events and visuals states designed to allow you to implement smooth speech to text experience. Clicking the button starts a listening action which can be processed and converted to text.

* [Path Button]({%slug radbuttons-features-pathbutton%})&mdash;Derives from RadButton, but provides the ability to set a Path alongside its content.

* [Hyperlink Button]({%slug radbuttons-features-hyperlink-button%})&mdash;Extends RadButton with hyperlink capabilities.
