# {{ site.framework_name }} RadBook Visual Structure

This section defines terms and concepts used in the scope of __RadBook__ you have to get familiar with prior to continue reading this help.

Below you can see a snapshot and explanation of the main visual elements of the __RadBook__ control.

* __Left Page__: This is the page that is rendered on the left side of the book.	

* __Right Page__: This is the page that is rendered on the right side of the book.
