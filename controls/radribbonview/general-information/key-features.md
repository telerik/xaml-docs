This is a list with short descriptions of the top-of-the-line features of Telerik's __RadRibbonView__ control.				

* __MS Office Interface at your Fingertips__ - The Telerik {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %} __RadRibbonView__ control enables you to build user interfaces similar to the ribbon control used in Microsoft Office.

* __Automatic Resizing and Minimization__ - Telerik {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF {% endif %} __RibbonView__ and its composite parts fully support automatic [resizing]({%slug radribbonview-resizing%}). The different groups and panels adjust their dimensions and internal layout dynamically to best accommodate the available space. Each [RibbonGroup]({%slug radribbonview-ribbon-group%}) has up to four different layouts, so that the control can be easily resized. The Telerik __RibbonView__ also supports [minimization]({%slug radribbonview-minimization%}) that allows you to hide the __RibbonView__ and let only the tabs appear, thus saving space. Clicking a tab will open the __RibbonView__ popup and let you use all its controls.					

* __Galleries and Pop-ups__ - Telerik {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF {% endif %} __RibbonView__ is built on modular pop-ups, in which are embedded galleries, menus and collapsed groups. All __RibbonView__ galleries and pop-ups mimic Office galleries exactly and fully comply with the ribbon UI requirements. Telerik __RibbonView__ allows you to fully control the pop-ups’ location, size and content.The __RibbonView__'s __ColorPicker__ galleries provide an advanced implementation for color selection.
