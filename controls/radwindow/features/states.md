# States



## 

The __RadWindow__ has three states:

* __Normal__ - this is the default state of the window and it appears as defined in the code.

* __Minimized__ - in this state the window is minimized.

* __Maximized__ - in this state the window is maximized.

The state of the __RadWindow__ can change depending on the user actions, but it can also be controlled from the code-behind. This is done by setting the __WindowState__ property which is of type __WindowState__ enumeration.

>Every time when the __RadWindow__ changes its state, the __WindowStateChanged__ event is raised. More about the __RadWindow__ events can be found [here]({%slug radwindow-events-overview%}).
