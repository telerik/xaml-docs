This is a list with short descriptions of the top-of-the-line features of Telerik's __RadWindow__ control.

* __Child Windows Across All Platforms__: Telerik __RadWindow__ enables you to create child windows in Silverlight, WPF and XBAP applications with the same API, functionality and appearance across all platforms. The [RadWindowManager]({%slug radwindow-features-radiwindowmanager%}) class makes it easy to control all currently open RadWindows.

* __Predefined Dialogs__: Telerik __RadWindow__ provides an easy way to replace the standard non-customizable dialog boxes (alert, confirm, and prompt) provided by the browser. With __RadWindow__ you can blend the popup into the applicationâ€™s design to achieve better user experience. [Read more]({%slug radwindow-features-predefined-dialogs%})

* __Styling and Appearance__: Telerik __RadWindow__ is a fully customizable control, which lets you easily modify all its visual elements. The control comes with several built-in skins that can be customized if needed. 

* __Configuration__: Telerik __RadWindow__ can be easily configured to suit the needs of your application. You have a full control over determining the initial [state]({%slug radwindow-features-states%}) and [position]({%slug radwindow-features-positioning%}) of the window, whether it can be [resized]({%slug radwindow-features-resizing%}), [closed]({%slug radwindow-features-closing%}) or [moved]({%slug radwindow-features-moving%}).
