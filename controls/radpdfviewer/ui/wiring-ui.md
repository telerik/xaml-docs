# Wiring UI

RadPdfViewer provides commands and respective command descriptors that you can easily bind to when creating UI.      

>tip Find a runnable project showing RadPdfViewer in the [WPF Samples GitHub repository](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/PdfViewer/FirstLook).        

The project is wired to work with RadToolBar and RadContextMenu.      

You can note how the DataContext of the toolbar is bound to the instance of __RadPdfViewer__ on the same page.
