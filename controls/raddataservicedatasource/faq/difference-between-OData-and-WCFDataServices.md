# What is the difference between OData and WCF Data Services ?



## 

__Q:__ What is the difference between __OData__ and __WCF Data Services__?

__A:__ __OData__ is a __protocol__ for querying data, while __WCF Data Services__ is one particular __implementation__ of this protocol. __WCF Data Services__ (formerly known as ___"ADO.NET Data Services"___) is a component of the __.NET Framework__ that enables you to create services that use the __Open Data Protocol__ (___OData___) to expose and consume data over the __Web__ or intranet by using the semantics of representational state transfer (___REST___).
