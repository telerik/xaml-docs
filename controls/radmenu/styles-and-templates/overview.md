# {{ site.framework_name }} RadMenu Overview

This section is intended to give you a broad understanding of the possible ways by which you can change the visual appearance of the __RadMenu__ and the __RadMenuItem__. 

You can modify the look of the __RadMenu__ and the __RadMenuItem__ either by changing some of the resources exposed by the API, or by modifying their __ControlTemplates__. In the control template you are allowed to reorder the template parts and add your own elements. However, when changing the control template you should be careful to include all required parts.

>Note that when changing the ControlTemplate you should include all required parts. Even if your code compiles, some of the functionality may be subject to impact due to the omission of the required parts. The required parts are usually marked with the prefix "__PART___".
