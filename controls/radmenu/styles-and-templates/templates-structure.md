# Templates Structure

Like most {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %} controls, the __RadMenu__ also allows you to template it in order to change the control from the inside. Except for templating the whole control, you can template parts of it or even independent controls related to it. This topic will make you familiar with the:

>tipFor more information about templating and how to modify the default templates of the controls from the of UI for {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %} suite read [Editing Control Templates article]({%slug styling-apperance-editing-control-templates%}) on this matter.      

## RadMenu Template Structure

This section will explain the structure of the __RadMenu__'s template. Here is a snapshot of the template generated in Expression Blend.

It contains the following parts:

* __[Border]__ - the layout root for the template and is of type __Border__. Visualizes the background and the border of the __RadMenu__.          

* __[ItemsPresenter]__ - represents the host control for the __RadMenu__'s items and is of type __ItemsPresenter__.          

## RadMenuItem Template Structures

The __RadMenuItem__ uses several templates depending on its place in the hierarchy. Before explaining the template structures, you must understand the different types of menu items depending on the hierarchy.

* __Top-Level Header Items__ - items that __are__ placed in the __top level__ of the hierarchy and __have__ child items.

* __Top-Level Items__ - items that __are__ placed in the __top level__ of the hierarchy and __don't have__ child items.

* __Submenu Header Items__ - items that __are not__ in the __top level__ of the hierarchy and __have__ child items.

* __Submenu Items__ - items that __are not__ in the __top level__ of the hierarchy and __don't have__ child items.

* __Separator Items__ - items that are marked as [separators]({%slug radmenu-features-separator-items%}).

Depending on this type, the appropriate template is selected. The __RadMenuItem__ exposes several properties of type __ControlTemplate__, that are used to set the different templates:

* __TopLevelHeaderTemplateKey__ - represents the template, applied when the item is a __Top-Level Header Item__.

* __TopLevelItemTemplateKey__ - represents the template, applied when the item is a __Top-Level Item__.

* __SubmenuHeaderTemplateKey__ - represents the template, applied when the item is __Submenu Header Item__.

* __SubmenuItemTemplateKey__ - represents the template, applied when the item is __Submenu Item__.

* __SeparatorTemplateKey__ - represents the template, applied when the item is __Separator Item__.

>The __Template__ property has the same effect as the __SubmenuItemTemplateKey__ property.
