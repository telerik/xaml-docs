# Localization



The built-in localization mechanism in {% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %} allows you to localize __RadPropertyGrid__ control.
      

Here is a list of the supported languages:
      
* __English__            
* __German__         
* __Spanish__           
* __French__
* __Italian__              
* __Dutch__             
* __Turkish__

## Resource Keys

In order to be able to distinguish the localization resources, a unique identifier, called __resource key__, is assigned to each localizable string.
        
Here is a list of the __Resources__ available and their default values:
        
<table><tr><td>Key</td><td>Value</td></tr><tr><td>Categorize</td><td>Categorize</td></tr><tr><td>Alphabetical</td><td>Alphabetical</td></tr></table>
