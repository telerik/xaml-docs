# {{ site.framework_name }} RadGanttView Types of Items

__RadGanttView__ control is used to display and update a list of task items using a data grid and a Gantt chart. A __task__ corresponds to some work to be completed. Tasks are often broken down into child tasks, thus forming a hierarchy.

>All the tasks in __RadGanttView__ are __Telerik.Windows.Controls.GanttView.GanttTask__ objects.
    
__RadGanttView__ provides the following types of tasks:

* __Regular task__ - task that have no child tasks.       	

* __Summary task__ - task with child tasks. They are set through SetChildren() method.

* __Milestone task__ - task with zero duration that corresponds to an event. 

__IsMilestone__ property should be set to true to create __Milestone__ tasks.

The following screenshot shows how the different types of tasks are visualised in the data grid and the Gantt chart:
