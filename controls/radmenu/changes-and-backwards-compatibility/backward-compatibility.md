__What to do now:__

In order to customize the current version of the control to look exactly as it was before the above change you will need to customize the __RadManuStyle__ and __RadMenuItemStyle__. You can find a runnable project that contains all of the necessary customizations in our online SDK repository
                  [here](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/Menu/OldMenuAndItemStyle). You can download the entire repository as a zip file via
                  [this](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/archive/master.zip) link.
