# {{ site.framework_name }} RadComboBox Clear Selection Button

This article demonstrates how to enable the clear selection button and change its content.

## Using ClearSelectionButtonVisibility and ClearSelectionButtonContent

The __RadComboBox__ offers an additional button displayed in the drop-down part, which is responsible for clearing the selection. By default this button is __not visible__. However you could make it visible by using the __ClearSelectionButtonVisibility__ property. Also you have the ability to set the content of the button clearing the selection to anything you want.

#### __XAML__

{{region radcombobox-features-clearselectionbutton_0}}
	<telerik:RadComboBox ClearSelectionButtonVisibility="Visible" ClearSelectionButtonContent="Clear Selection"/>
{{endregion}}
