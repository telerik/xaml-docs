__Key Features:__

{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}
* __Display Modes__: You can display the calendar in four different views - Months, Years, Decades and Centuries. Thus, you can adjust the calendar component to meet your very own business needs.          

* __Multiple Months View__: RadCalendar can be easily configured to show more than one month in the calendar area. Thus, you can make the navigation easier and faster.

* __Powerful DataBinding__: Telerik RadCalendar for Silverlight can be bound to various datasoure types, such as such as Object, XML and WCF services.

* __Selection Mode__: RadCalendar supports both single and multi-date selection. This behavior can be changed by using a single property.         

* __Selection Range__: Set the range of the dates the user will be able to navigate to, and a constraint on the dates that can be selected.          

* __Keyboard Navigation__: RadCalendar supports the standard browser navigation paradigm. Users can tab across the page elements till they reach the calendar element. Then they can go forward/backward over the individual days by pressing the [Tab]/[Shift+Tab] keys. A day can be selected by clicking the [Enter] button.

* __Styling and Appearance__: RadCalendar can be fully customized using Expression Blend. There are also several pre-defined themes that can be used to stylize the calendar control.

* __Month and year views__: RadCalendar provides month and year views.
