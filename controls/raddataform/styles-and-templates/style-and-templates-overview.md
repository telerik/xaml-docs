# Overview


This section is intended to give you a broad understanding of the possible ways by which you can change the visual appearance of the __RadDataForm__ and its elements. There is also comprehensive information about their __ControlTemplates__. You will need this information, if you want to customize their appearance.
		

>To learn how to style __Telerik UI for__ read the common topics about[Setting a Theme (Using Implicit Styles)]({%slug styling-apperance-implicit-styles-overview%})

>There is also another way to obtain the template of a particular visual element. In the __RadControls__ installation folder on your PC, go to __Themes__ folder (__Themes.Implicit in case you're using__) and select the theme that you use in your application. Then drill down to find the respective __Telerik.Windows.Controls.Data.xaml__ file in that directory. From this resource dictionary you can extract any needed resources.
		  

Note that when changing the __ControlTemplate__, you should include all required parts. Even if your code compiles, some of the functionality may be subject to impact due to the omission of the required parts. The required parts are usually marked with the prefix "PART_".
