# Tool Window

__ToolWindow__ is the container control that hosts all panes that are in a floating state. Every time you drag a pane and undock it, a new instance of the class __Telerik.Windows.Controls.Docking.ToolWindow__ is created to host that pane for you.

>The implementation of the __RadDocking__ never requires you to work with __ToolWindows__ directly, but with the Pane hosted inside it. For example, to make a __ToolWindow__ not closable, just set the property __CanUserClose__ of the hosted RadPane to __False__.

In the figure below you can see two ToolWindows with a floating pane inside of each one.

You can learn how to declare such a floating structure in the [Floating Panes](#Floating_Panes) help article.

## Setting FloatingSize and FloatingLocation

__RadDocking__ provides the ability to easily set the initial floating size and location of the __ToolWindows__. To do that, use the __RadDocking.FloatingSize__ and __RadDocking.FloatingLocation__ attached properties, as shown in Example 1:
