# Appearance



To customize the appearance of the __RadButtons__ you can use the standard properties that are provided by the __Control__ class, like __Background__, __Foreground__, __Effect__ etc.

Also you can use the __RadButtons__ specific properties:

* __CornerRadius__ - specifies the value for the radius of the button's corners.

* __IsBackgroundVisible__ - specifies whether the background is visible, when the button is in its __Normal__ state.

## Styling the RadButtons

Applying a style to the button is the most efficient way to customize its appearance. The styles can be reused between buttons, which will make your code easier to maintain.

By using a __Style__ you can also entirely change the appearance of the button. This is done by modifying its __ControlTemplate__. To learn more about styling the __RadButtons__ read [here]({%slug radbuttons-styles-and-templates-overview%}).
