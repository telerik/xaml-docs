# {{ site.framework_name }} RadContextMenu Overview

In order to display items, you have to populate the __RadContextMenu__ control with some data. You can do this in two ways:

* Manually, by adding items to the __Items__ collection. 

* With data binding, by using the __ItemsSource__ property.

>You __can't__ have items added manually to the __Items__ collection and set the __ItemsSource__ at the same time.
