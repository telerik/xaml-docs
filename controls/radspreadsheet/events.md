# {{ site.framework_name }} RadSpreadsheet Events

This topic describes the events you can use in RadSpreadsheet so you can get a notification about different actions.

* [RadSpreadsheet Events](#radspreadsheet-events)
* [Workbook Events](#workbook-events)
* [Worksheet Events](#worksheet-events)
* [RadWorksheetEditor Events](#radworksheeteditor-events)
* [Cells Events](#cells-events)
* [Row/Column Events](#rowcolumn-events)


## RadSpreadsheet Events

* **ActiveSheetChanged**: Occurs when the active sheet is changed.

* **ActiveSheetEditorChanged**: Occurs when the active sheet editor is changed.

* **MessageShowing**: Occurs when the user is presented with a warning message. The event arguments are of type **MessageShowingEventArgs** and expose the following properties:
	* **IsHandled**: Gets or sets whether the event is handled.
	* **Header**: Gets or sets the header of the message.
	* **Content**: Gets or sets the content of the message.
	* **NotificationType**: Gets or sets the type of the notification. The property is of type [MessageBoxNotificationType](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/wpf/api/telerik.windows.controls.spreadsheet.dialogs.messageboxnotificationtype).

	The code from **Example 1** shows how to disable the messages appearing when the user is trying to edit a protected worksheet.

	#### **[C#] Example 1: Disable messages related to protection using the MessageShowing event**
	{{region radspreadsheet-events_0}}

		public void AttachToMessageShowingEvent()
		{
		    this.radSpreadsheet.MessageShowing += radSpreadsheet_MessageShowing;
		}
		
		private void radSpreadsheet_MessageShowing(object sender, Telerik.Windows.Controls.Spreadsheet.MessageShowingEventArgs e)
		{
		    if (e.NotificationType == Telerik.Windows.Controls.Spreadsheet.Dialogs.MessageBoxNotificationType.ProtectedWorksheetError)
		    {
		        e.IsHandled = true;
		    }
		}
	{{endregion}} 

	#### **[VB.NET] Example 1: Disable messages related to protection using the MessageShowing event**
	{{region radspreadsheet-events_3}}
	    Public Sub AttachToMessageShowingEvent()
	        AddHandler Me.radSpreadsheet.MessageShowing, AddressOf radSpreadsheet_MessageShowing
	    End Sub
	
	    Private Sub radSpreadsheet_MessageShowing(sender As Object, e As Telerik.Windows.Controls.Spreadsheet.MessageShowingEventArgs)
	        If e.NotificationType = Telerik.Windows.Controls.Spreadsheet.Dialogs.MessageBoxNotificationType.ProtectedWorksheetError Then
	            e.IsHandled = True
	        End If
	    End Sub
	{{endregion}} 

* **WorkbookCommandError**: Notifies that an error occurred while executing a command in RadSpreadsheet. The arguments are of type **CommandErrorEventArgs** and you can use the **Exception** property to check what exactly the error is.

* **WorkbookChanging**: Occurs when the workbook starts changing.

* **WorkbookChanged**: Occurs when the workbook is changed.

* **WorkbookCommandExecuting**: Occurs when workbook command starts executing. The arguments are of type [CommandExecutingEventArgs](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/wpf/api/telerik.windows.documents.spreadsheet.commands.commandexecutingeventargs) and allow you to cancel the execution of the command.  

	#### **[C#] Example 2: Cancel a command through WorkbookCommandExecuting**
	
	{{region radspreadsheet-events_1}}
	
		private void radSpreadsheet_WorkbookCommandExecuting(object sender, Telerik.Windows.Documents.Spreadsheet.Commands.CommandExecutingEventArgs e)
		{
		    if (e.CommandName == "AddShapeCommand")
		    {
		        e.Cancel();
		    }
		}
	{{endregion}}

	#### **[VB.NET] Example 2: Cancel a command through WorkbookCommandExecuting**
	
	{{region radspreadsheet-events_4}}
	
	    Public Sub AttachToWorkbookCommandExecutingEvent()
	        AddHandler Me.radSpreadsheet.WorkbookCommandExecuting, AddressOf radSpreadsheet_WorkbookCommandExecuting
	    End Sub
	
	    Private Sub radSpreadsheet_WorkbookCommandExecuting(sender As Object, e As Telerik.Windows.Documents.Spreadsheet.Commands.CommandExecutingEventArgs)
	        If e.CommandName = "AddShapeCommand" Then
	            e.Cancel()
	        End If
	    End Sub
	{{endregion}}
* **WorkbookCommandExecuted**: Occurs when workbook command is executed.

* **WorkbookContentChanged**: Occurs when the content of the workbook is changed.


## Workbook Events


* **ActiveSheetChanged**: Occurs when the active sheet is changed.

* **WorkbookContentChanged**: Occurs when the workbook content is changed.

* **IsProtectedChanged**: Occurs when the current protection state has changed.

>The events related to selection in RadSpreadsheet are described in the [Working with UI Selection]({%slug radspreadsheet-ui-working-with-selection%}) topic.

## Cells Events

* **CellPropertyChanged**: Occurs when a property of a cell is changed. The event arguments are of type **CellPropertyChangedEventArgs** and expose information about the exact property that was changed as well as the affected cell range.

	**Example 3** demonstrates how you can use the event to get a notification when the users change the fill of a cell.

	#### **[C#] Example 3: Using the CellPropertyChangedEvent**
	{{region radspreadsheet-events_2}}
		
		public void AttachToCellPropertyChangedEvent()
		{
		    this.radSpreadsheet.ActiveWorksheet.Cells.CellPropertyChanged += Cells_CellPropertyChanged;
		}
		
		private void Cells_CellPropertyChanged(object sender, CellPropertyChangedEventArgs e)
		{
		    if (e.Property == CellPropertyDefinitions.FillProperty)
		    {
		        MessageBox.Show("The fill of a cell was changed!");
		    }
		}
	{{endregion}}

	#### **[VB.NET] Example 3: Using the CellPropertyChangedEvent**
	{{region radspreadsheet-events_5}}
		
	    Public Sub AttachToCellPropertyChangedEvent()
	        AddHandler Me.radSpreadsheet.ActiveWorksheet.Cells.CellPropertyChanged, AddressOf Cells_CellPropertyChanged
	    End Sub
	
	    Private Sub Cells_CellPropertyChanged(sender As Object, e As CellPropertyChangedEventArgs)
	        If e.Property = CellPropertyDefinitions.FillProperty Then
	            MessageBox.Show("The fill of a cell was changed!")
	        End If
	    End Sub
	{{endregion}}


* **CellRangeInsertedOrRemoved**: Occurs when a cell range is inserted or removed. Through the arguments, you can obtain information about the affected ranges, as well as whether the range is removed or not.

* **MergedCellsChanged**: Occurs when the merged cells collection in a worksheet is changed. The MergedCellRangesChangedEventArgs class represents the event arguments and holds the cell range related to the change.


## Row/Column Events

* **ColumnsWidthChanged**: Occurs when the columns' widths are changed.

* **RowsHeightsChanged**: Occurs when the rows' heights are changed.

The arguments of the two events are of type **RowColumnPropertyChangedEventArgs** and expose the following properties:

* **Property**: Gets the property that was changed.
* **FromIndex**: Gets the first index of the changed range.
* **ToIndex**: Gets the last index of the changed range.
