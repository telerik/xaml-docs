# {{ site.framework_name }} RadScheduleView Inline Editing

RadScheduleView supports inline editing of the displayed appointment's subject. The purpose of this tutorial is to show you:	

* [How to start, commit and cancel the inline process run-time](#how-to-start-commit-and-cancel-the-inline-process-run-time)

* [How to enable\disable the inline editing behavior](#how-to-enabledisable-the-inline-editing-behavior)

## How to start, commit and cancel the inline process run-time.

Inline editing lets you edit the appointment's subject right where you see it in the appointment. Just select the appointment, press F2 and type your changes.

* Select the target appointment:

>tipPressing the __Enter__ key will apply your changes, while pressing the __Esc__ key will reject them.

>It is important to know that if you edit an appointment which is result of recurrence, then the changes will be applied to the whole series.

## How to enable\disable the inline editing behavior

The RadScheduleView exposes a property __IsInlineEditingEnabled__ which allows you to enable\disable the inline editing behavior.

>tipThe default value of the __IsInlineEditingEnabled__ property is True. Which means that the inline editing behavior is allowed by default.

If you want to disable the inline editing behavior, you should set the __IsInlineEditingEnabled__ property to False.
