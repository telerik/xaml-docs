# Events

This topic covers the specific events exposed by the __RadDesktopAlert__ control.

__RadDesktopAlert__ control raises the following specific events:

* __Click__ - occurs when RadDesktopAlert gets clicked.

* __Closed__ - occurs each time RadDesktopAlert gets closed.

	Both events receive two arguments:

	* The __sender__ argument contains alert instance. This argument is of type object, but can be cast to __RadDesktopAlert__ type.

	* A __RadRoutedEventArgs__ object.
