# {{ site.framework_name }} RadMap Localization

The built-in localization mechanism in Silverlight and WPF allows you to localize any string resource used by the standard __RadMap__ control. Once translated you might use your resources in both Silverlight and WPF projects without changing anything.

>tip __To learn more about the ways in which to localize the RadControls please read the common topic about__ [Localization](http://www.telerik.com/help/silverlight/common-localization.html)__.__

## Resource Keys

__RadMap__ is a user interface control and its strings for localization are numerous. In order to be able to distinguish these resources, an unique identifier, called __resource key__, is assigned to each localizable string.

Here is a list of all of the __Resources__ available and their default values:
