>tip Get started with the control with its [Getting Started]({%slug radvirtualkeyboard-getting-started%}) help article that shows how to use it in a basic scenario.

## Key Features

* __Native key input__&mdash;The keyboard device is not focusable and each button click sends a native key down action that is passed to the currently focused element. This means that no special code for binding the keyboard component with the input element is required.

* __Customizeable layouts__&mdash;The buttons layout can be customized by implementing custom key layout factory class or by loading an .xml file with a special format.

* __Language culture support__&mdash;You can assign a specific culture that will be applied to the letter keys or you can enable the automatic synchronization with the current OS input language.

* __Sound__&mdash; The keyboard supports a clicking sound that is played on button press. The sound can be disabled or replaced with a custom one.

* __Customizeable buttons__&mdash;The visualization of each button can be customized with `DataTemplates`.
