# {{ site.framework_name }} RadGridView Applied DataFormatString on a Column



## Why isnâ€™t this format used when performing filtering?
          

The __DataFormatString is only used for presentation purposes__. It plays absolutely no part in the data engine and all __filtering, sorting and grouping operations are always performed on raw data values__ in the data engine.

Each GridViewColumn has a property called __FilterMemberPath__. You can use this property to tell the column to __filter on a property different from the one it displays__ in its cells. 
        

>tipFor example: FilterMemberPath="PropertyToFilterOn". You can also check the [FilterMemberPath documentation]({%slug gridview-filtering-basic%}).
