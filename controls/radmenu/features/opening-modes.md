# {{ site.framework_name }} RadMenu Opening Modes

If a menu item in the __RadMenu__ control contains any children, they are shown depending on a user action. There are two opening modes that recognize the following two actions:

* The child items are shown when the mouse is over the parent.

* The child items are shown when the user clicks on the parent.

This behavior of the __RadMenu__ control can be controlled via the __ClickToOpen__ property. The default value is __False__ which means that the child items are displayed upon a hover action.

![{{ site.framework_name }} RadMenu Open Child Items on Hover](images/RadMenu_Features_Opening_Modes_01.png)

Setting the property to __True__ will make the child items appear upon a mouse click on their parent. Note that the children do not automatically hide,  but they will wait for a mouse click again.

#### __XAML__

{{region xaml-radmenu-features-opening-modes_0}}
	<telerik:RadMenu ClickToOpen="True">
	    ...
	</telerik:RadMenu>
{{endregion}}

To illustrate this case here is a snapshot of the menu upon a hover:

and upon a mouse click:
