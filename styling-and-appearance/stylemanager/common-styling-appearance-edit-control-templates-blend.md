1. Open your Solution Explorer (View->Solution Explorer or use the Ctrl+Alt+L shortcut).

1. Select your user controls.

1. Right mouse button click and select "__Open in Expression Blend...__".{% endif %}

* In the "__Objects and Timeline__" pane (Window->Objects and Timeline) select the __Telerik control__ for which you want to create (modify) a style.

* __Edit Current__ - if you choose it, this will open the currently applied style for edit.

>If you don't have an applied style to the control, this option will be disabled.

* __Edit a Copy...__ - edit a copy of the __default__ style. When you select this option a new dialog will be opened.

The "Create Style Resource" dialog will prompt you to select a name for your style, as well as to choose the location where your style will be defined in.

* __Create Empty...__- create an empty style for the selected control. When you select this option, the same "Create Style Resource" dialog will be opened. You should select a name for the style, as well as to choose the location where your style will be defined in.

The "Create Style Resource" dialog will prompt you to select a name for your template, as well as to choose the location where your style will be defined in.

>Note that __Edit a Copy...__ will not declare you a copy of the default template as a resource in your XAML. Instead, it will create a copy of the default style with a ControlTemplate setter.

* __Create Empty...__ - create an empty template for the selected control. When you select this option, the same "Create Style Resource" dialog will be opened. You should select a name for the template, as well as to choose the location where your template will be defined in.

>In contrast to the __"Edit a Copy..."__ option, the __"Create Empty..."__ will create a new ControlTemplate as a resource in your XAML.

>It is not recommended to choose the __"Create Empty..."__ option, unless you are familiar with __TemplatedParts__ for the specific control.
