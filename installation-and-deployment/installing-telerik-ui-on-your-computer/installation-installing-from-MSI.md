# Installing UI for Silverlight from MSI File

The following topic describes what steps you should perform in order to install Telerik UI for Silverlight from a __MSI__ file.

The [MSI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Installer) files are intended for an easy and automatic installation of a product. The MSI installs the suite on your computer to a folder named Telerik in your Program Files, automatically creating the necessary virtual folders and projects.

For more information about which installation package you need to install, read [here]({%slug installation-installing-which-file-do-i-need%}).

For more information about the system requirements, read [here]({%slug installation-system-requirements%}).

>tipThe latest package available for download already has all updates/HOTFIXES applied. There is no need to update it further.

>tipThe MSI installation __will not overwrite__ previous Telerik UI for Silverlight installations, unless it is of the same version.

>Since Q3 2012 release Silverlight 4 assemblies are not shipped any more.

## Exploring the Installation Folder

If you open the installation folder ( __C:\Program Files\Telerik\UI for Silverlight [version]__ ) you will probably note the following sub directories:

* __Binaries__ - the standard binaries including theme dlls.

* __Binaries.NoXaml__ - binaries without XAML.

* __LicenseAgreements__

* __Themes.Implicit__ - implicit styles friendly XAML.
        
* __VSExtensions__

>importantWith the Q1 2014 release we no longer provide the Themes and pdb files within the installation package. You could download them separately from the UI for Silverlight download page in your [Telerik account](http://www.telerik.com/account.aspx).

>The Silverlight Demos application can be downloaded from the UI for Silverlight download page (in the [Telerik account](http://www.telerik.com/account.aspx)) as a separate ZIP file as well.
