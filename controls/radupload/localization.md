# {{ site.framework_name }} RadUpload Localization

The built-in localization mechanism in {{ site.framework_name }} allows you to localize any string resource used by the standard __RadUpload__ control. Once translated you might use your resources in {{ site.framework_name }} projects without changing anything.

## Resource Keys

__RadUpload__ is a complex user interface control and its strings for localization are numerous. In order to be able to distinguish these resources, a unique identifier called __resource key__ is assigned to each localizable string.
