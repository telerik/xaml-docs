# {{ site.framework_name }} RadBreadcrumb Events Overview

This topic covers the specific events exposed by the __RadBreadcrumb__ control:

* __CurrentItemChanged__: Occurs after the value of the __CurrentItem__property of a breadcrumb is changed. The __CurrentItemChanged__ event receives two arguments:

    * The **sender** argument contains the __RadBreadcrumb__. This argument is of type object, but can be cast to the __RadBreadcrumb__ type. 

    * A __RadRoutedEventArgs__ object.
