# {{ site.framework_name }} RadCardView Localization

The built-in [localization mechanism](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/advanced/wpf-globalization-and-localization-overview?view=netframeworkdesktop-4.8) in the platform allows you to localize __RadCardView__ control. 

Here is a list of the supported languages:

* English            
* German          
* Spanish           
* French
* Italian              
* Dutch             
* Turkish
