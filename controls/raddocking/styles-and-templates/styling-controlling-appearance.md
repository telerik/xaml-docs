# Controlling Appearance



## 

There are a number of ways to customize the look and feel of your __RadDocking__ control. This topic covers some of the most useful of these properties.

* Use [RadPaneGroup]({%slug raddocking-features-pane-groups%}) to organize your panes. You can group them both [run-time](#Grouping_Panes_Run-time) or [programmatically](#Grouping_Panes_Programmatically). 


* [Pin](#Pinning_All_Panes)/[Unpin](#Unpining_All_Panes) or [Hide](#Hiding_All_Panes)/[Show](#Showing_All_Panes) all panes via the appropriate __RadPaneGroup__ methods. 


* [Set relative size of nested RadPaneGroups](#Set_Relative_Size_to_the_RadPaneGroup) using the attached property __ProportionalStackPanel.RelativeSize__. 


* Use [RadSplitContainer]({%slug raddocking-features-split-container%}) to split your panes according to your needs. 


* Change the orientation of your __RadSplitContainer__ to __Horizontal__ or __Vertical__ using its __Orientation__ property as shown [here](#Setting_the_Orientation_Property_in_XAML). 


* Control the initial docking positions of your panes via the __InitialPosition__ property of the __RadSplitContainer__ class. Choose between __DockedLeft__, __DockedRight__, __DockedTop__, __DockedBottom__, __FloatingDockable__ and __FloatingOnly__. To learn more read [this](#Setting_the_InitialPosition_of_the_RadSplitContainer_in_XAML). 


* Specify the [size](#Setting_the_Initial_FloatingSize_of_the_RadSplitContainer) and [location](#Setting_the_Initial_FloatingLocation_of_the_RadSplitContainer) of your [floating panes](#Floating_Panes) using the attached properties __RadDocking.FloatingSize__ and __RadDocking.FloatingPosition__. 


* Moreover you can change the look and feel of your __RadDocking__ controls completely using [styles]({%slug raddocking-styling-overview%}), [themes]({%slug raddocking-theming-overview%}) and [templates]({%slug raddocking-styles-and-templates-templates-structure%}).
