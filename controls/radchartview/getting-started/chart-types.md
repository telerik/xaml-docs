* __VerticalAxis__: A property of type __CartesianAxis__ which gets or sets the vertical axis of the charting component.

* __Series__: A property of type __PresenterCollection<CartesianSeries>__ which gets the series of the charting component. You can add and remove series from the collection. 

* __SmartLabelsStrategy__: A property of type __ChartSmartLabelsStrategyBase__ which gets or sets the labels arranging strategy of the series. It is useful in cases where labels are overlapping.
