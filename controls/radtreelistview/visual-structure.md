* __Tree List__ - one of the columns of the __RadTreeListView__ contains the UI for the tree structure. This is similar to what the __RadTreeView__ displays.

* __Expander__ - represents the UI element used to expand the respective item. If the item has no children, no expander will be displayed.

* __Hierarchy Indent__ - represents the indent that visualizes the data hierarchy - the child items are shifted to the right with the value of this indent. This indent is applied only in the first column.

* __Nodes__ - represent the items in the hierarchy. Each node might have other nodes as children and thus might be expandable.
