# {{ site.framework_name }} RadLayoutControl Events

This article contains basic information about the events available with __RadLayoutControl__ and its components.

## RadLayoutControl events

The layout control has the following event.

* __SelectionChanged__: Occurs when the selection changes. The event arguments are of type __LayoutControlSelectionChangedEventArgs__  and have the following properties:
	
	* __NewItem__: A property of type __object__ that gets the selected item.
	* __OldItem__: A property of type __object__ that gets the previously selected item.
	* __AllowedActions__: A property of type __LayoutControlAllowedActions__ gets or sets the allowed operations for the selected item. 	
	
		> You can use this property to forbid specific input device (mouse, touch) interactions as drag, resize and the manipulation actions available in the [ManipulationPane]({%slug radlayoutcontrol-edit-the-layout%}).
	
		The property is an enum and it has the following values:
		* __None__: No actions will be available 
		* __Resize__: Resize action will be available
		* __Drag__: Drag action will be available
		* __ManipulationPaneActions__: The manipulation pane will be available
		
		The default value of the __AllowedActions__ property is __Resize | Drag | ManipulationPaneActions__, which means that all actions are available. If the property is set to __None__, all actions are forbidden and a lock icon will be displayed over the selected item.
		
		#### __[C#] Example 1: Setting allowed actions__

			}
		{{endregion}}
