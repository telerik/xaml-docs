This is a list with short descriptions of the top-of-the-line features of Telerik's __RadWindow__ control:
        

* __Child Windows Across All Platforms and Scenarios__ - Telerik __RadWindow__ makes possible to create Child Windows in Silverlight, WPF and XBAP applications with the same API, functionality and appearance across all platforms and scenarios.
          

* __Predefined Dialogs__ - Telerik __RadWindow__ provides an easy way to replace the standard non-customizable dialog boxes (alert, confirm, and prompt) provided by the browser. With __RadWindow__ you can blend the popup into the application’s design to achieve better user experience. [Read more]({%slug radwindow-features-predefined-dialogs%})

* __Customizable Behavior__ - Telerik __RadWindow__ basic behavior can be configured with a few clicks. You have a full control over determining the initial [state]({%slug radwindow-features-states%}) of the window and whether it can be [resized]({%slug radwindow-features-resizing%}).
          

* __Configuration__ - Telerik __RadWindow__ gives you full freedom to choose its [state]({%slug radwindow-features-states%}) and [position]({%slug radwindow-features-positioning%}) parameters.
          

* __Customizable Content__ - in case of complex scenarios, you can implement any element such as basic shapes, panels and user controls inside the __RadWindow__.
          

* __Silverlight/WPF Code Compatibility__ - Telerik __RadWindow__ shares a single codebase with its WPF counterpart. This means that you can achieve close to 100% code reuse for your modal popus if you have parallel Silverlight/WPF development.
          

* __Codeless Test Automation for RadWindow__ - Now you can record, execute and debug functional tests for __RadWindow__ without leaving the familiar Visual Studio environment.
