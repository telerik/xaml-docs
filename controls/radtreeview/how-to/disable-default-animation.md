# {{ site.framework_name }} RadTreeView Disable Default Animation in RadTreeView

By default the __RadTreeView__ control's items are __expanded__ and __collapsed__ with an animation. However, there are cases when you might want to disable these animations, e.g. when you have a large number of subitems and it takes a longer time for the animations to complete. To disable the default animations, all you have to do is to set the following attached property to the __RadTreeView__ control:  

#### __XAML__

{{region radtreeview-how-to-disable-default-animation_0}}
	<telerik:RadTreeView telerik:AnimationManager.IsAnimationEnabled="False"/>
{{endregion}}

The referenced namespace is defined as follows: 

#### __XAML__

{{region radtreeview-how-to-disable-default-animation_1}}
	xmlns:telerik=http://schemas.telerik.com/2008/xaml/presentation
{{endregion}}

Once you have declared the needed namespace, the only thing you have to do is setting the attached property to __False__. All treeview items will inherit that property from their parent __RadTreeView__.

>The default duration of the expand animation is 2 seconds.
