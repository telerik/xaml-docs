Thank you for choosing __Telerik RadDateTimePicker__!

__RadDateTimePicker__ is a convenient way to get rid of the boring date and time parsing and data validation. __RadDateTimePicker__ is an easy and simple, but yet essential way to improve end-user experience. By setting the **InputMode** property you can use __RadDateTimePicker__ as a __DatePicker__, __TimePicker__ or __both__. Moreover, you can control the layout of the popups that show time and/or date values as well as use the rich data model in {{ site.framework_name }} to populate content dynamically.

## Key Features

This is a list with short descriptions of the top-of-the-line features of the Telerik __RadDateTimePicker__ control:        

* __DatePicker and TimePicker controls__: __DatePicker__ and __TimePicker__ are both incorporated in the __RadDateTimePicker__ control. You can choose to use either one or both. [Read more]({%slug raddatetimepicker-features-input-modes%})

* __Display Modes__: You can display the __DateTimePicker__ in four different views - **Months**, **Years**, **Decades** and **Centuries**. Thus, you can adjust the date-time-picker component to meet your very own business needs. [Read more]({%slug raddatetimepicker-features-date-selection-modes%})

* __Powerful Databinding__: The {{ site.framework_name }} __DateTimePicker__ control by Telerik can be bound to various datasource types, such as Object, XML and WCF services.          

* __Keyboard Navigation__: __RadDateTimePicker__ supports the standard browser navigation paradigm. Once the control has focus, you can press the **Down Arrow** key to show the calendar. The users can go forward/backward over the individual days by pressing the arrow keys. Pressing the **Tab** key will move the focus to the time-picker where you can once again navigate. Tabbing again will focus the **Close** button which will close the picker. [Read more]({%slug raddatetimepicker-features-keyboard-support%})

* __Advanced Parser__: You can enter any number or string in the input field of __RadDateTimePicker__ and the entered value will be transformed to a valid date.  For example, if you type "1", the first day of the month will be shown after leaving the input field. [Read more]({%slug raddatetimepicker-features-militaryparsing%})

* __Styling and Appearance__: Telerik {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %} __RadDateTimePicker__ can be fully customized using Expression Blend. There are also several pre-defined themes that can be used to style the control. [Read more]({%slug raddatetimepicker-styling-overview%})

* __Enhanced Routed Events Framework__: To help your code become even more elegant and concise, we implemented an Enhanced Routed Events Framework for the controls from the __UI for {{ site.framework_name }}__ suite.  This gives you more freedom when you design your applications since you can write instance handlers as well as class handlers for the routed events of our controls.

* __Watermark__: The __DateTimePicker__ control allows the user to define and use watermarks in the date and time fields. [Read more]({%slug raddatetimepicker-features-watermark%})
