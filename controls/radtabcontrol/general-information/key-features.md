* __UI Automation Support__ - as the Silverlight platform exposes a full accessibility tree through UIA (UI Automation), Telerik RadControls for Silverlight fully support UI Automation for UI elements access/manipulation, screen readers and other accessibility tools.
					

* __Enhanced Routed Events Framework__ - to help your code become even more elegant and concise, we implemented Enhanced Routed Events Framework for RadControls for {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %}.  This gives you more freedom when you design your applications, since you can write instance handlers as well as class handlers for the routed events of our controls.
					

* __Expression Blend support__ – all RadControls for {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %} can be easily customized using Expression Blend.
