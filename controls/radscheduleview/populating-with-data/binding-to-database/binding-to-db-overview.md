# {{ site.framework_name }} RadScheduleView Overview

The section aims to give you a general understanding of how you can bind the RadScheduleView control to data coming from a database.

The next articles in this section will explain the types and sources which the RadScheduleView control uses, the interfaces which are needed for the control to function as expected, the relationships between these interfaces and how you can implement them to work with Entity Framework.

You can find two fully-functioning examples in our [SDK Samples Browser]({%slug sdk-samples-browser%}) which demonstrate two approaches for setting up your project by using **Entity Framework** - with a database-first and a code-first approach. The source code of these examples can also be found in our GitHub repository:

* [Database-First Approach](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ScheduleView/Database)
* [Code-First Approach](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ScheduleView/DatabaseEntityFramework)
