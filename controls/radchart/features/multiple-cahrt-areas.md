# {{ site.framework_name }} RadChart Multiple Chart Areas



## 

In the most common cases your __RadChart__ will consist of a [ChartTitle]({%slug radchart-features-chart-title%}), a [ChartLegend]({%slug radchart-features-chart-legend%}) and a [ChartArea]({%slug radchart-features-chart-area%}). But there are also cases when you want to display more than one __ChartArea__ in the same __RadChart__ control. For example something like this:

![{{ site.framework_name }} RadChart Multiple Chart Areas](images/RadChart_Multiple_ChartAreas_01.png)

To learn more about how to display your data in separate __ChartAreas__ take a look at the [Data Binding to Many Chart Areas]({%slug radchart-populating-with-data-data-binding-to-many-chart-areas%}) topic.
