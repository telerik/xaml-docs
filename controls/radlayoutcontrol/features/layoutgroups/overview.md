# Overview

__LayoutControl__ can work both directly with UIElements or dedicated layout group controls. The layout groups give you the ability to nest the elements displayed in the layout into one another which allows you to create more complex layouts. LayoutControl provides the following group controls.

* [LayoutControlGroup]({%slug radlayoutcontrol-features-layougroups-layoutcontrolgroup%})
* [LayoutControlTabGroup]({%slug radlayoutcontrol-features-layoutgroups-layoutcontroltabgroup%})
* [LayoutControlExpanderGroup]({%slug radlayoutcontrol-features-layoutgroups-layoutcontrolexpandergroup%})

## Common Features

This section lists the features that are common between the layout groups.

* __Orientation__: The layout group allows you to change the orientation in which its children should be arrange. You can do that through the __Orientation__ property. You can read more about this in the [Orientation]({%slug radlayoutcontrol-features-orientation%}) help article.

	> __LayoutControlTabGroup__ cannot change its orientation. Setting the property won't affect the tab items arrangement.
