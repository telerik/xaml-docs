* __NavigationHeader__ - used for switching the ViewDefinitions of the ScheduleView as well as changing the current date. It can be easily hidden by setting the __NavigationHeaderVisibility__ property of the ScheduleView to "Collapsed". __Figure 2__ shows it in more details. 

* __TimeRuler__ - it represents the time axis of the ScheduleView. The TimeRuler can be vertical or horizontal according to the active [ViewDefinition orientation]({%slug radscheduleview-viewdefinitions-configuration%}). Additionally, you could customize it by following the instructions in [Configuring the TimeRuler ticks]({%slug radscheduleview-features-timeruler-ticks-configuration%}) topic.

* __Appointment__ - it represents a single piece of data that is visualized in the ScheduleView. For more details on the appointments, check the [Understanding Appointments]({%slug radscheduleview-getting-started-add-edit-delete-appointment%}) as well as [Populating with Data]({%slug radscheduleview-populating-with-data-data-binding-support-overview%}) topics.

* __GroupHeader__ - represent the date and the resources (when the ScheduleView is grouped) headers. The group headers can be vertical or horizontal depending on the active [ViewDefinition]({%slug radscheduleview-viewdefinitions-overview%}) and its orientation. You could check [Styling the GroupHeaders]({%slug radscheduleview-styles-and-templates-styling-groupheaders%}) and [Templating the GroupHeaders]({%slug radscheduleview-styles-and-templates-templating-groupheaders%}) topics for detailed information on customizing the look and feel of the GroupHeaders.

* __Slot__ - represent the timeslots of the control defined by the TimeRuler. Furthermore, RadScheduleView provides the option to create [Special and ReadOnly slots]({%slug radscheduleview-features-speacialslots%}).

* __Selected Slot__, __Highlighted Slot__ - represent the selected/hightlighted state of the Slot. The slot selection behavior can be customizing following the instructions in the [SlotSelectionBehavior]({%slug radscheduleview-features-slot-selection-behavior%}) topic.

__Figure 2__ shows the NavigationHeader in more details:

* __NavigationDefinition Selection__ - used to navigate between the available [ViewDefinitions]({%slug radscheduleview-viewdefinitions-overview%}) in the ScheduleView.

* __NavigationDateTimePicker__ - opens a Calendar for easier changing of the CurrentDate of the ScheduleView.

* __NavigationBack, NavigationNext__ - decrease or increase the CurrentDate of the ScheduleView according to the ViewDefinition LargeChangeInterval property. For more details check the ViewDefinitions [Configuration]({%slug radscheduleview-viewdefinitions-configuration%}) topic.
