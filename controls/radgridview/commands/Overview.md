# Overview

RadGridView provides a set of built-in commands that enables you to easily handle the User Interface actions, but still make your logic independent of the UI layout. Thus, you are free of subscribing to a particular event for achieving the desired behavior. 

All supported commands are defined in the RadGridViewCommands class and are listed below:

* __ActivateRow__ - activates a particular row programmatically and fires the __RowActivated__ event of the __RadGridView__.
		  

* __BeginEdit__ - invokes editing of the selected item.
		  

* __BeginInsert__ - starts the process of inserting a new row in the __RadGridView__.
		  

* __CancelCellEdit__ - causes the editing of the current cell to be stopped and the changes to be discarded. However, this command will not overcome failed validation.
		  

* __CancelRowEdit__ - causes the editing of the whole row to be discontinued. Again, this command will not overcome failed validation.

* __CloseSearchPanel__: Executed in order to hide the search panel.
			

* __CollapseHierarchyItem, ExpandHierarchyItem__ - expands/ collapses a particular item in the hierarchy.
		  

* __CommitCellEdit__ - forces all the changes to the cell to be committed.
		  

* __CommitEdit__ - forces all the changes to be committed.
		  

* __Copy, Paste__ - enable you to take advantage of the clipboard functionality.
		  

* __Delete__ - removes the selected item from the collection.
		  

* __MoveBottom, MoveTop__ - moves the focus to the cell situated in the bottom/top item.
		  

* __MoveUp, MoveDown__ - moves the focus to the cell situated in the item above/below the selected one.
		  

* __MoveFirst, MoveLast__ - moves the focus to the cell situated in the first/last item.
		  

* __MoveLeft, MoveRight__ - moves the focus to the cell situated in the left/right side of the selected one.
		  

* __MoveUp, MoveDown__ - moves the focus to the cell situated above/ below the selected one.
		  

* __MoveNext, MovePrevious__ - moves the focus to the next/ previous cell. Once the first/last cell on the row is reached, it will jump to the cell in the previous/ next row.
		  

* __MoveHome__ - moves the focus to the cell situated in the first item.

* __Search__: Executed in order to show the search panel.
		  

* __SelectCurrentItem__ - selects the current item.
		  

* __SelectCurrentUnit__ - selects the current unit. By default the selection unit is __"FullRow"__, but the __SelectionUnit__ property may also be set to __"Cell"__, thus enabling a cell-based selection.
		  

* __ExtendSelectionToCurrentUnit__ - selects all the selection unit from the anchor upto the chosen unit.

As the commands provided by __RadGridView__ are __ICommands__ at their core, they do provide methods both for checking if they can be invoked - __CanExecute()__ and for invoking it - __Execute()__. 
		

Using the __RadGridViewCommands__ class, you can set a consequence of commands to be performed one after another as if simultaneously.  So, for example, you may easily handle the Click event of a button that moves the focus down, selects the current unit and delete it. However, when invoking the commands in such a manner a second parameter should be added, pointing out the target UI Element.
