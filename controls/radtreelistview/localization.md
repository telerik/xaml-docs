# {{ site.framework_name }} RadTreeListView Localization

The built-in localization mechanism in {% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %} allows you to localize __RadTreeListView__ control.      

Here is a list of the supported languages:
      
* English            
* German          
* Spanish           
* French
* Italian              
* Dutch             
* Turkish

>tipTo learn more about the ways in which to localize the RadControls, please read the common topic about [Localization]({%slug common-localization%}).

## Resource Keys

__RadTreeListView__ inherits the _RadGridViewDataControl so it shares its resource keys and does not expose any specific ones. To see a list of all resource keys and their default values read the [Localization]({%slug gridview-localization2%}) topic for __RadGridView__.
