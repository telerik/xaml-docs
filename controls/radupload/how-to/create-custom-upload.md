# Create Custom RadUpload Control

If you need to create your own Upload control, you can rely on the __RadUpload__ control to prepare your files for upload behind the scenes.

For example, if your application contains a custom control that creates a list of files for upload, you can create a __RadUpload__ in code-behind to manage the files and upload them on the server.

In order to do so, you will need to manually add the list of the files into the __CurrentSession.SelectedFiles__ collection:

#### __[C#] Example 1: Selecting files__  
{{region cs-radupload-how-to-create-custom-upload_0}}
	//create a RadUpload to handle the upload
	RadUpload upload = new RadUpload;
	// get a collection of files from the local system
	List<FileInfo> files = new List<FileInfo>();
	// add files 
	// . . . 
	// insert files in the RadUpload
	if (files.Count > 0)
	{
	 foreach (FileInfo file in files)
	 {
	  RadUploadSelectedFile f = new RadUploadSelectedFile(file);
	  upload.CurrentSession.SelectedFiles.Add(f);
	 }
	//prepare for upload
	...
	}

#### __[VB.NET] Example 1: Selecting files__  
{{region vb-radupload-how-to-create-custom-upload_1}}
	    Dim upload As New RadUpload()
	    ' get some files from the local system
	    Dim files As New List(Of FileInfo)()
	    ' add some files 
	    ' . . . 
	    ' insert files in the RadUpload
	    If files.Count > 0 Then
	     For Each file As FileInfo In files
	    Dim f As New RadUploadSelectedFile(file)
	      upload.CurrentSession.SelectedFiles.Add(f)
	     Next
	    ' prepare for upload
	    End If
{{endregion}}

>tip The __RadUploadSelectedFile__ class has a constructor that allows you to create a new instance from a __Stream__ object: RadUploadSelectedFile f = new RadUploadSelectedFile(fileStream,fileName). However, in order to create a valid object of tyle __RadUploadSelectedFile__, you need to make sure that the __fileStream Position__ is set to the beginning of the stream: fileStream.Position=0L. Only then you can use the __Stream__ object to create a __RadUploadSelectedFile__ instance.

Then you have to prepare the RadUpload control for the upload process. The __PrepareSelectedFilesForUpload__ method facilitates the implementation of such scenarios by setting the __RadUpload__ in a state ready to upload the manually added __CurrentSession.SelectedFiles__ collection:

#### __[C#] Example 2: Preparing for upload__  
{{region cs-radupload-how-to-create-custom-upload_2}}
	// prepare for upload
	 this.upload.PrepareSelectedFilesForUpload();
{{endregion}}

#### __[VB.NET] Example 2: Preparing for upload__  
{{region vb-radupload-how-to-create-custom-upload_3}}
	    upload.PrepareSelectedFilesForUpload()
{{endregion}}

Finally, you need to start the upload:

#### __[C#] Example 3: Starting the  upload__  
{{region cs-radupload-how-to-create-custom-upload_4}}
	this.upload.StartUpload();
{{endregion}}

#### __[VB.NET] Example 3: Starting the  upload__  
{{region vb-radupload-how-to-create-custom-upload_5}}
	upload.StartUpload()
{{endregion}}
