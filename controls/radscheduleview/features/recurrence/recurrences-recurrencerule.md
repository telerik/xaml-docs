# {{ site.framework_name }} RadScheduleView RecurrenceRule

__RadScheduleView__ includes support for recurring events on daily, weekly, monthly and yearly basis. Exceptions to the recurrence rules are also permitted. To support this recurrence behavior, the __IAppointment__ interface includes the __RecurrenceRule__ property. When an appointment is promoted into a recurring event its __RecurrenceRule__ is set with correct [RecurrencePattern]({%slug radscheduleview-features-recurrences-recurrencepattern%}).     

The __RecurrenceRule__ class is the engine for creating and evaluating recurrence rules.      

The purpose of this tutorial is to show you:

* The main properties exposed by the __RecurrenceRule__ class:

	* [RecurrencePattern](#recurrencepattern)

	* [Exceptions](#exceptions)

* [How to create a recurrence rule and associate it with an appointment](#how-to-create-a-recurrence-rule-and-associate-it-with-an-appointment)

* [How to add exception occurrences to the recurrence rule](#how-to-add-exception-occurrences-to-the-recurrence-rule)

## RecurrenceRule Class

While the __RecurrencePattern__ class carries the main information about the occurrence, the __RecurrenceRule__ class is the engine for creating and evaluating recurrence rules.        

The __RecurrenceRule__ class is located in the __Telerik.Windows.Controls.ScheduleView__ namespace of the __Telerik.Windows.Controls.ScheduleView.dll__ assembly.        

The next several sections describe which are the main properties and methods exposed by the __RecurrenceRule__ class.        

## RecurrencePattern

The __RecurrenceRule__ class exposes a __RecurrencePattern__ property, which allows you to get\set the recurrence pattern associated with the current rule. For more information about the __RecurrencePattern__, take a look at the [RecurrencePattern]({%slug radscheduleview-features-recurrences-recurrencepattern%}) topic, which is entirely dedicated to recurrence patterns.        

## Exceptions

The __RecurrenceRule__ class exposes an __Exceptions__ property, which allows you to get or set all exception occurrences associated with the current rule. For more information read [How to Add Exception Occurrences to the Recurrence Rule](#how-to-add-exception-occurrences-to-the-recurrence-rule)

## How to Create a Recurrence Rule and Associate it With an Appointment

The __RecurrenceRule__ class has only one public constructor, which accepts a __RecurrencePattern__ as a parameter.        

>tipThe __RecurrencePattern__ is a mandatory part of the __RecurrenceRule__. Which means that when creating a new __RecurrenceRule__ you must associate the rule with a recurrence pattern.        

#### __C#__

{{region radscheduleview-features-recurrences-recurrencerule_0}}
	var startDate = new DateTime(2011, 05, 11, 10, 0, 0);
	var fitnessAppointment = new Appointment()
	{
	    Start = startDate,
	    End = startDate.AddHours(2),
	    Subject = "Fitness"
	};
	var recurrencePattern = new RecurrencePattern()
	{
	    Frequency = RecurrenceFrequency.Weekly,
	    MaxOccurrences = 30,
	    DaysOfWeekMask = RecurrenceDays.Monday | RecurrenceDays.Wednesday | RecurrenceDays.Friday
	};        
	fitnessAppointment.RecurrenceRule = new RecurrenceRule(recurrencePattern);
{{endregion}}

#### __VB.NET__

{{region radscheduleview-features-recurrences-recurrencerule_1}}
	Dim startDate = New DateTime(2011, 5, 11, 10, 0, 0)
	Dim fitnessAppointment = New Appointment() With {
	    .Start = startDate,
	    .[End] = startDate.AddHours(2),
	    .Subject = "Fitness"
	}
	Dim recurrencePattern = New RecurrencePattern() With {
	    .Frequency = RecurrenceFrequency.Weekly,
	    .MaxOccurrences = 30,
	    .DaysOfWeekMask = RecurrenceDays.Monday Or RecurrenceDays.Wednesday Or RecurrenceDays.Friday
	}
	fitnessAppointment.RecurrenceRule = New RecurrenceRule(recurrencePattern)
{{endregion}}

The above example shows you how to create a recurrence pattern, then how to associate it with a recurrence rule. Finally the recurrence rule is assigned to an appointment.

## How to Add Exception Occurrences to the Recurrence Rule

__RadScheduleView's__ API permits you to add exception occurrences to the recurrence rule. In order to add exceptions, you should use the __RecurrenceRule__'s __AddException()__ method. The __AddException()__ method has two overloads.        

The first one takes two parameters:

* The first parameter is a __DateTime__ which indicates when the exception occurs.
          
* The second parameter is an __IAppointment__ instance. This is the exception appointment.

When you want to add an exception to a recurrence you need to use this method.

The second overload takes only one argument - a __DateTime__ parameter. The purpose of this overload is to add an exception by __removing__ a given occurrence from a recurrence.

One possible scenario of adding an exception to a recurrence rule is shown in the next example:

* Create a new appointment.

#### __VB.NET__

{{region radscheduleview-features-recurrences-recurrencerule_11}}
	fitnessAppointment.RecurrenceRule = rule

When adding the created appointment to the __RadScheduleView__'s __AppointmentsSource__ collection the result should be similar to the snapshot below.
