## Resource Keys

__RadGridView__ is a complex user interface control and its strings for localization are numerous. In order to be able to distinguish these resources, an unique identifier, called __resource key__, is assigned to each localizable string.

On the picture below you can see some of the resource keys and the strings they are associated with.
