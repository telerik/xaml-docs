## Key Features

* __Customizable image content__: The control allows you to easily set the splash screen image. Read more in the [Splash Screen Manager]({%slug radsplashscreen-features-splashscreenmanager%}) article.

* __Built-in progress bar__: By default the control shows an indeterminate [RadProgressBar]({%slug getting_started%}#indeterminate-state). You can easily change this and indicate some loading progress. Read more in the [Progress Bar]({%slug radsplashscreen-features-progress-bar%}) article.

* __Customizable content/footer UI__: You can customize the content/footer of the splash screen by defining a template or by only setting the Content/Footer properties.

* __Animations__: The control comes with show and hide animations that can be modified, replaced or removed. Read more in the [Animations]({%slug radsplashscreen-features-animations%}) article.

* __Rich set of themes__: You can use the Telerik themes to modernize your UI or implement different designs that can be changed at runtime. Read more in the [Setting a Theme]({%slug styling-apperance-implicit-styles-overview%}) article.
