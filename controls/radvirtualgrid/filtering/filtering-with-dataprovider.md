# {{ site.framework_name }} RadVirtualGrid Filtering with DataProvider

When __RadVirtualGrid__ populates its data through the __DataProvider__ mechanism, the filtering operation will be handled out-of-the-box. By default, the filtering of the control is enabled. The user can filter the data through the UI by clicking the filtering funnel in the column headers.

> The filtering of __RadVirtualGrid__ can be disabled by setting the __IsFilterable__ property to __false__.

> The __FilteringControl__ of __RadVirtualGrid__ can be manually closed by calling the __CloseFilteringControl__ method of the control.

## Filtering

After applying the needed filtering criteria, the control will appear as follows.

## Filtering through ColumnFilterDescriptor

The __ColumnFilterDescriptor__ for a given column can be fetched through the __GetFilterDescriptorForColumn__ method. This can be done by providing the index of the needed column.

#### __[C#] Example 1: Getting the ColumnFilterDescriptor of a column__

{{region radvirtualgrid-filtering-with-data-provider_0}}
	var descriptor = this.VirtualGrid.GetFilterDescriptorForColumn(0);
{{endregion}}

Then, the data can be filtered by adding/removing __DistinctFilters__ to the __DistinctFilter__ of the __ColumnFilterDescriptor__. 

#### __[C#] Example 2: Adding distinct values__

{{region radvirtualgrid-filtering-with-data-provider_1}}
	var distinctFilter = this.VirtualGrid.GetFilterDescriptorForColumn(0).DistinctFilter;
        distinctFilter.AddDistinctValue("Liverpool");
        distinctFilter.AddDistinctValue("Chelsea");
{{endregion}}

## Deferred Filtering 

By default, the filtering operation will be processed as soon as the user chooses a distinct filter from the predefined list. This behavior can be altered through the __IsFilteringDeferred__ property. By setting it to __True__, the filtering criteria will be evaluated only when the user presses the __Filter Button__.
