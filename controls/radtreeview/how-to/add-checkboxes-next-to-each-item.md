# {{ site.framework_name }} RadTreeView Add Check Boxes (Radio Buttons) Next to Each Item

This tutorial demonstrates how to take advantage of the built-in CheckBox support in the __RadTreeViewItems__.

__RadTreeView__ provides check boxes displayed next to each item. Enable this behavior by setting the __IsOptionElementsEnabled__ property of the __RadTreeView__ to __True__.

To handle the change of the item check state use the __PreviewChecked__, __Checked__, __PreviewUnchecked__ and __Unchecked__ events. These events are available both on the __RadTreeView__ and on the __RadTreeViewItem__ classes.

To see the Item check state use the __CheckState__ property of the __RadTreeViewItem__ class. The __CheckState__ property is a __ToggleState__ enumeration and has the following values:		

* __On__ - the Item is checked.
* __Off__ - the Item is not checked.
* __Indeterminate__ - the Item has items that are checked and items that are not checked. This state is available only when the RadTreeView __IsTriStateMode__ property is set to __True__.

If the check boxes need to have "tri-states" set the __IsTriStateMode__ property of the __RadTreeView__ to __True__. When this mode is activated the __CheckState__ property of each item is depending on the __CheckState__ property of its child items. In this mode the item will be checked only if all of its child items are checked too.

> Please keep in mind that the __RadTreeView__ 'tri-state' check boxes logic is desined to work in declaratively populated __RadTreeView__ control. This is why if your applicaiton implements an MVVM approach and the __RadTreeView__ is databound, it's best to define custom 'tri-state' logic in your ViewModels following [this  tutorial]({%slug radtreeview-howto-tri-state-mvvm%}).
