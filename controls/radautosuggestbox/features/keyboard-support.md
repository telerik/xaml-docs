# {{ site.framework_name }} RadAutoSuggestBox Keyboard Support

The RadAutoSuggestBox control provides several actions executed via the keyboard.

The supported keys are  __Up__, __Down__, __Escape__ and __Enter__.

* __Up__ and __Down__: Those keys allow you to navigate through the drop down list of the control.

* __Enter__: The key executes the query submitted action which fires the __QuerySubmitted__ event.

* __Escape__: When you navigate in the drop down list using the Up and Down keys, the last typed text is cached. If you press the Esc key, the cached text will get reverted.
