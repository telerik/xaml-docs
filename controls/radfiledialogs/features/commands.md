# {{ site.framework_name }} RadFileDialogs Commands

The file dialogs suite provides several commands used to interact with the controls. All commands can be found in the __FileDialogsCommands__ static class. The commands are attached to the controls' operations as copy, cut, open folder/file, delete, etc. 

If you use the __ExplorerControl__ it might be useful to execute the commands manually in some cases. To do so, you can call the __Execute()__ method of the corresponding ICommand implementation. Alternatively, you can set the command to the Command property of a button or a similar component.

> All commands in the FileDialogsCommands class are objects of type [RoutedUICommand](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.input.routeduicommand(v=vs.110).aspx).

#### __[C#] Example 1: Executing a command in code__
{{region radfiledialogs-features-commands-0}}
	RoutedUICommand command = (RoutedUICommand)FileDialogsCommands.Delete;
	command.Execute(this.explorerControl, this.explorerControl);
{{endregion}}

#### __[XAML] Example 2: Assigning a command to a Button in XAML__
{{region radfiledialogs-features-commands-1}}
	<Grid>
        <fileDialogs:ExplorerControl x:Name="explorerControl"/>
        <Button Command="fileDialogs:FileDialogsCommands.Delete"
                CommandParameter="{Binding ElementName=explorerControl}"
                CommandTarget="{Binding ElementName=explorerControl}"
                Content="Delete"/>
    </Grid>
{{endregion}}

## List of Commands

* __NewFolder Command__: This command creates a new folder in the current directory. It is executed when you press the [New Folder Button]({%slug radfiledialogs-visual-structure%}) or call the command manually as shown in __Examples 1 and 2__.

> Most of those commands are also available in the context menu opened on right mouse click in the dialog control.

## Cancel Keyboard Commands

To cancel the command executed for a specific key or a keycombo you can handle the __PreviewKeyDown event__ of the dialog control.

#### __[C#] Example 3: Canceling Delete command in ExplorerControl__
{{region radfiledialogs-features-commands-2}}
	private void ExplorerControl_PreviewKeyDown(object sender, KeyEventArgs args)
	{
		if (args.Key == Key.Delete)
		{
			args.Handled = true;
		}
	}
{{endregion}}

#### __[XAML] Example 4: Canceling Delete command in a dialog control__
{{region radfiledialogs-features-commands-3}}
	RadOpenFileDialog openFileDialog = new RadOpenFileDialog();
	openFileDialog.Owner = this;
	openFileDialog.PreviewKeyDown += (s, args) =>
	{
		if (args.Key == Key.Delete)
		{
			args.Handled = true;
		}
	};
	openFileDialog.ShowDialog();
{{endregion}}
