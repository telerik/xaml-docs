# {{ site.framework_name }} RadVirtualGrid Implementation

The following article will go through the process of utilizing the built-in commands of __RadVirtualGrid__.

A straightforward approach for implementing the commands is to set them directly to a particular __RadButton__. Thus, once you click a single button, the predefined command will be executed. 

#### __[XAML] Example 1: Using RadButton for triggering a built-in command__
{{region radvirtualgrid-commands_implementation_0}}
	<telerik:RadButton Width="150" Content="Begin edit" 
           Command="telerik:RadVirtualGridCommands.BeginEdit" 
           CommandTarget="{Binding ElementName=VirtualGrid}" />
{{endregion}}

Note, that the target object needs to be explicitly set in the definition of the __CommandTarget__ Property, specifying the RadVirtualGrid towards which the command has to be applied.
