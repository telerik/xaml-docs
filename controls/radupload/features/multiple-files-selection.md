# Multiple Files Selection

By default the __RadUpload__ allows you to select and upload multiple files. If you want the user to select and upload only one file at a time you can set the __IsMultiselect__ property to __False__ (its default value is __True__).

>Disabling the multiple file selection will also disable [multiple times file selection]({%slug radupload-features-multiple-times-file-selection%}).

#### __[XAML] Example 1: Enabling the multiple files selection__  
{{region xaml-radupload-features-multiple-files-selection_0}}
	<telerik:RadUpload IsMultiselect="False" />
{{endregion}}
