# Hiding Rows

You can hide or show rows by configuring a __FilterDescriptor__ that filters the bound items by a certain condition. 

For the purpose, Filtering criteria should be defined as explained in the [Programmatic Filtering]({%slug gridview-filtering-programmatic%}) article. As another example, you can find some sample code on the {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}[Programmatic Filtering Demo](http://demos.telerik.com/silverlight/#GridView/ProgrammaticFiltering){% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}[Programmatic Filtering Demo](http://demos.telerik.com/wpf){% endif %}.
