![{{ site.framework_name }} RadRibbonView Paint Application](images/RibbonView_paint.png)

This is a list with short descriptions of the top-of-the-line features of Telerik's __RadRibbonView__ control.				

* __MS Office Interface at your Fingertips__ - The Telerik {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %} __RadRibbonView__ control enables you to build user interfaces similar to the ribbon control used in Microsoft Office. This feature ensures that your applications will look up to date with the latest Microsoft applications with which your users are already familiar.

* __Automatic Resizing and Minimization__ - Telerik {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF {% endif %} __RibbonView__ and its composite parts fully support automatic [resizing]({%slug radribbonview-resizing%}). The different groups and panels adjust their dimensions and internal layout dynamically to best accommodate the available space. Each [RibbonGroup]({%slug radribbonview-ribbon-group%}) has up to four different layouts, so that the control can be easily resized. The Telerik __RibbonView__ also supports [minimization]({%slug radribbonview-minimization%}) that allows you to hide the __RibbonView__ and let only the tabs appear, thus saving space. Clicking a tab will open the __RibbonView__ popup and let you use all its controls.					

* __Galleries and Pop-ups__ - Telerik {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF {% endif %} __RibbonView__ is built on modular pop-ups, in which are embedded galleries, menus and collapsed groups. All __RibbonView__ galleries and pop-ups mimic Office galleries exactly and fully comply with the ribbon UI requirements. Telerik __RibbonView__ allows you to fully control the pop-ups’ location, size and content.The __RibbonView__'s __ColorPicker__ galleries provide an advanced implementation for color selection.

* __Backstage Menu__ -  the Backstage menu is accessible through the __ApplicationMenuButton__ on the left.  It can be used to display standard buttons like Save, Print and Send, as well as to provide a list of recent documents, access to application options for changing user settings and preferences, and application exit.

* __Application Menu__- the Application menu is accessible through the __ApplicationMenuButton__ on the left.

* __Quick Access Toolbar__ - the __RibbonView__'s quick access toolbar is usually displayed either in the window's title bar or below the __RibbonView__.

* __Nested Controls__ - Telerik {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %} suite supplies all controls that you will need in a ribbon control.

* __Enhanced Routed Events Framework__ - to help your code become even more elegant and concise, Enhanced Routed Events Framework for __RadControls__ for {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %} is implemented.

* __Codeless Test Automation for RibbonView__ - now you can record, execute and debug functional tests for the RibbonView without leaving the familiar Visual Studio environment.
