# Data Binding



## 

__RadTabControl__ takes a full advantage of the __DataBinding__ in {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %}.

* Use DataContext to provide data for data binding. Read more [here]({%slug radtabcontrol-populating-data-binding%}). 

* Use data binding to bind a property to an object’s value. 

* Use data binding to bind the __RadTabControl__ to a collection, in order to create tabs dynamically on the basis of the collection items. Read more [here]({%slug radtabcontrol-populating-binding-to-collection%}). 
          

* Use the __TwoWay__ data binding mode, so you can provide interaction between the __RadTabControl__ and the bound object. 

* Use __DataBinding__ in combination with converter so you can easily adjust the value to your needs.
