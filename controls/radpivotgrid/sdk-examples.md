# SDK Examples

The [Telerik XAML SDK repository](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/) provides additional demos for most of the Telerik UI for {% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %} controls. The examples demonstrate many specific user case scenarios, that might be really helpful. In this article you can find the complete list of all SDK examples for __RadPivotGrid__.

## List of all RadPivotGrid SDK examples:

{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}
* __Local data source calculated fields__ - In this example you will find out how to add Calculated Field to your data from LocalDataSourceProvider in order to calculate the commission that will be paid to the salespeople.

* __Queryable CalculatedFields__ - 
In this example you will find out how to add Calculated Field to your data from QueryableDataSourceProvider.

* __Local data source calculated items__ - In this example you will find out how to add Calculated Items to your data from LocalDataSourceProvider.

* __Queryable CalculatedItems__ - 
In this example you will find out how to add Calculated Items to your data from QueryableDataSourceProvider.

* __Custom cell template__ - This example demonstrates how to create a custom CellTemplate and use CellTemplateSelector to apply it based on a specific condition.

* __Custom ContextMenuBehavior__ - This example demonstrates how to implement a custom ContextMenuBehavior, which will allow you to modify the ContextMenus in RadPivotFieldList.
    The following scenarios are covered in the example:
    - The Label Filter of the PropertyGroupDescription items is removed
    - There is option added to change the step of the DoubleGroupDescription items 
    - There is option added to color the cells of the AggregateDescription items depending on some condition

* __Custom header template__ - This example demonstrates how to create a custom HeaderTemplate and use HeaderTemplateSelector to apply it based on a specific condition.

* __Customize FieldTree__ - This example demonstrates how to customize your dateTime field tree ( hide/show different groups - Month, Minute ) and how to remove a field from the FieldTree.

* __Custom localization__ - In this example you will find out how to localize RadPivotGrid by creating custom Localization Manager.

* __Expand behavior__ - In this example you will find out how to change the expand/collapse behavior of RadPivotGrid.

* __Export PivotGrid__ - In this example you will find out how to export RadPivotGrid to xlsx (MS Excel file), docx (MS Word file), HTML and pdf.

* __Persist AdomdDataProvider__ - This example demonstrates how to persist an AdomdDataProvider using the Telerik Persistence Framework.

* __Persist LocalDataSourceProvider__ - This example demonstrates how to persist a LocalDataSourceProvider using the Telerik Persistence Framework.

* __Persist XmlaDataProvider__ - This example demonstrates how to persist a XmlaDataProvider using the Telerik Persistence Framework.
