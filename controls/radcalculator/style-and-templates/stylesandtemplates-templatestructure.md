Except for templating the whole control, you can template parts of it or even independent controls related to it.
		  

>To learn how to style {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %} RadControls read the common topics about Styling and Appearance. If you are new to the controls, they will give you the basic knowledge about it.
