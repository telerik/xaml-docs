# {{ site.framework_name }} RadFileDialogs Overview

Whenever you open or save a file in almost any Windows application, you will see roughly the same dialogs for doing so. As of **R3 2017** you can keep the UI appearance throughout your application consistent with the new file dialogs provided by the **Telerik UI for WPF** suite.

Apart from support of all predefined themes of the suite, the controls provide most of the functionality of the standard MS dialogs while leaving room for further customization.

## Key Features

Here are a few of the controls' main features:

* **Easy Navigation**: The dialogs allow you to easily browse through your file system either through the **tree-view-like navigation pane** or the **breadcrumb/path pane**. A **history** of the visited folders is kept so that you can seamlessly jump back and forth between folders.

* **Search**: The out-of-the-box search functionality allows you to quickly find just the files and folders you're looking for by using the **Windows Search index** when available.

* **Customizable Layouts**: The controls also provide you with an API to set an **InitialDirectory**, specify **custom folders** to be displayed top-most in the navigation pane and switch between **different view modes** (Tiles, Small Icons, Large Icons, etc.).

* **Variety of Themes**: You can persist the appearance throughout your application by applying any of the **predefined themes** provided by the UI for WPF suite to your dialogs.

* **Keyboard Navigation Support**: You can easily navigate through the **tree-view-like navigation pane**, the **breadcrumb/path pane** and the files in all layouts by just pressing the arrow keys on your keyboard.

* **Windows File System Synchronization**: The dialogs provide seemless synchronization with the Windows File System. Adding, renaming or deleting operations on files are reflected in the dialogs instantly. 

* **New Folder Functionality**: You can add a new folder in all dialogs with the **New Folder** button.

* **Context Menu**: The dialogs use the well-known Windows context menu. 

* **Editing**: The controls provide file and folder names editing via the F2 key or mouse click.

* **Touch Support**: The dialogs also provide out-of-the-box touch support.

* **Drive/Directory Filtering**: You can filter all drives and directories with the **DirectoryRequesting** event.

* **Codeless Тest Аutomation**: You can record, execute and debug functional tests for the controls without leaving the familiar Visual Studio environment.

* **Environment variables**: The dialogs support the usage of all system and user-defined enviroment variables.

* **Network Locations**: The controls allow you to display network locations by setting the **ShowNetworkLocations** property.

* **Localization Support**: The control supports localization that allows you to use it with different culture settings. Read more, in the [Localization]({%slug radfiledialogs-localization%}) article.
 
The file dialogs also support many other features of the native Windows file dialogs.
