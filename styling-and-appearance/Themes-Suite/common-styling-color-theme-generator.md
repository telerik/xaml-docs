# Color Theme Generator

The **VisualStudio2013**, **Office2016**, **Office2013**, **Green**, **Windows8Touch** and **Windows8** themes are fully customizable using the available brushes to adjust each color. 

For seamless color customization and faster palette creation that looks great and matches all controls, we created the **Color Theme Generator**.
     
## What is the Color Theme Generator?

The **Color Theme Generator** enables you to tweak theme colors and immediately see the results. The tool contains a few predefined palettes for each of the themes, making it easier to choose the right colors for your application.

It only takes a few simple steps:

* Change the color settings of brushes on the right
* Immediately see the effect on the left
* Go through all available controls from the tab on the right to see how each control looks
* When satisfied with the results, copy the code of the generated palette to the clipboard and simply drop it in your application.

You can always hit the reset button to start over. 

The source code of the application can be found in the downloads section of your **Telerik** account.
