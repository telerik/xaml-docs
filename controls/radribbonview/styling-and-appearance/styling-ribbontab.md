# {{ site.framework_name }} RadRibbonView Styling the RadRibbonTab

The __RadRibbonTab__ can be styled by creating an appropriate __Style__ and setting it to the __Style__ property of the control.			

You have two options:

* To create an empty style and set it up on your own.
* To copy the default style of the control and modify it.

This topic will show you how to perform the second one.

## Modifying the Default Style

To copy the default style, load your project in Expression Blend and open the User Control that holds the __RadRibbonView__. In the 'Objects and Timeline' pane select the __RadRibbonTab__ you want to style.				

{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}
![{{ site.framework_name }} RadRibbonView  ](images/RibbonView_Styling_RibbonTab_Locate.png)
{% endif %}
{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}
![{{ site.framework_name }} RadRibbonView  ](images/RibbonView_Styling_RibbonTab_LocateWPF.png)
{% endif %}

From the menu choose *Object -> Edit Style -> Edit a Copy*. You will be prompted for the name of the style and where to be placed.

>tip If you choose to define the style in Application, it would be available for the entire application. This allows you to define a style only once and then reuse it where needed.

After clicking 'OK', Expression Blend will generate the default style of the __RadRibbonTab__ control in the __Resources__ section of your User Control. The properties available for the style will be loaded in the 'Properties' pane and you will be able to modify their default values.

{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}

If you go to the 'Resources' pane, you will see an editable list of resources generated together with the style and used by it. In this list you will find the brushes, styles and templates needed to change the visual appearance of the __RadRibbonTab.__ Their names indicate to which part of the __RadRibbonTab's__ appearance they are assigned.

* __TabStripTabDividerBrush__ - a brush that represents the color of the separators used to divide the tab headers.
* __TabMouseOverOuterBorder__ - a brush that represents the color of the __RadRibbonTab.Header's__ outer border, when the mouse is over it
* __TabMouseOverInnerBorder__ - a brush that represents the color of the __RadRibbonTab.Header's__ inner border, when the mouse is over it
* __TabMouseOverBackground__ - a brush that represents the background color of the __RadRibbonTab.Header__, when the mouse is over it
* __TabSelectedOuterBorder__ - a brush that represents the color of the __RadRibbonTab.Header's__ outer border, when it is selected
* __TabSelectedInnerBorder__ - a brush that represents the color of the __RadRibbonTab.Header's__ inner border, when it is selected
* __TabSelectedBackground__ - a brush that represents the background color of the __RadRibbonTab.Header__, when it is selected
* __RibbonTabOuterBorderBrush__ - a brush that represents the color of the __RadRibbonTab.Content's__ outer border
* __RibbonTabBackgroundBrush__ - a brush that represents the background color of the __RadRibbonTab.Content__ __RibbonTabInnerBorderBrush__ - a brush that represents the color of the __RadRibbonTab.Content's__ inner border
* __RibbonTabInnerCornerRadius__ - the __CornerRadius__ of the __RadRibbonTab.Content's__ inner border
* __RibbonTabOuterCornerRadius__ - the __CornerRadius__ of the __RadRibbonTab.Content's__ outer border					

>tip Changing the value of the resources can be done by clicking on the color indicator or the icon next to them.

Modify the resources to bring the desired appearance to the __RadRibbonTab__. For more detailed information, please, view the [Example](#example) section below.					

If you want to change the __ControlTemplate__ elements of the __RadRibbonTab__ select the style in the 'Objects and Timeline' pane, right-click on it and choose Edit Template -> Edit Current. In the same pane the element parts for the __RadRibbonTab__'s template will get loaded.

{% endif %}

{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}

You can modify these properties to achieve the desired appearance. However most of the visual parts of the __RadRibbonTab__ have to be styled in its template. To modify it select the style in the 'Objects and Timeline' pane, right-click on it and choose *Edit Template -> Edit Current*. In the same pane the element parts for the __RadRibbonTab's__ template will get loaded.

{% endif %}
