# Format Providers Manager



 __RadSpreadprocessing__ contains a __WorkbookFormatProvidersManager__ class that allows you to specify a set of format providers and import or export files letting the manager to choose the appropriate format provider. The class also exposes methods that return all registered providers and supported file extensions.
      

* [Registering Unregistering Format Providers](#registering-and-unregistering-format-providers)

* [Import](#import)

* [Export](#export)

* [Retrieve Registered Providers and Supported Extensions](#retrieve-registered-providers-and-supported-extensions)

## Registering and Unregistering Format Providers

The __WorkbookFormatProvidersManager__ class contains two methods that allow you to register and unregister format providers respectively. The manager has the csv and txt format providers registered by default. The following snippet illustrates how to register the xlsx format provider.
        

>Unlike the __CsvFormatProvider__ and __TxtFormatProvider__ classes, using __XlsxFormatProvider__ requires references to the following assemblies:
          

>* Telerik.Windows.Documents.Spreadsheet.FormatProviders.OpenXml.dll
              

>* Telerik.Windows.Zip.dll
              

#### __C#__

{{region radspreadprocessing-formats-and-conversion-format-providers-manager_0}}
    WorkbookFormatProvidersManager.RegisterFormatProvider(new XlsxFormatProvider());
{{endregion}}



#### __VB__

{{region radspreadprocessing-formats-and-conversion-format-providers-manager_0}}
	 WorkbookFormatProvidersManager.RegisterFormatProvider(New XlsxFormatProvider())
{{endregion}}




You can also unregister format providers using the UnregisterFormatProvider() method. For example, the snippet below demonstrates how to unregister the TxtFormatProvider.
        

#### __C#__

{{region radspreadprocessing-formats-and-conversion-format-providers-manager_1}}
    IWorkbookFormatProvider provider = WorkbookFormatProvidersManager.GetProviderByName("TxtFormatProvider");
    if (provider != null)
    {
        WorkbookFormatProvidersManager.UnregisterFormatProvider(provider);
    }
{{endregion}}



#### __VB__

{{region radspreadprocessing-formats-and-conversion-format-providers-manager_1}}
    Dim provider As IWorkbookFormatProvider = WorkbookFormatProvidersManager.GetProviderByName("TxtFormatProvider")
    If provider IsNot Nothing Then
        WorkbookFormatProvidersManager.UnregisterFormatProvider(provider)
    End If
{{endregion}}

## Import

The format providers manager exposes an Import() method that takes one string argument, which specifies the extension of the file to be imported, and a Stream argument, which provides access to the file. The method tries to find a registered format provider that can handle the extension of the file you would like to import, and if such a provider is registered the file is imported. If the manager does not have an appropriate format registered, an __UnsupportedFileFormatException__ is thrown.
        

The following example demonstrates how to present the user with an OpenFileDialog and try to import the selected file. Note that you can use the __GetOpenFileDialogFilter()__ method of the __FileDialogHelper__ class to constructs the correct filter for all registered format providers.

            {
                workbook = WorkbookFormatProvidersManager.Import(extension, input);
            }
        }
        catch (IOException ex)
        {
            throw new IOException("The file cannot be opened. It might be locked by another application.", ex);

        Catch ex As IOException
            Throw New IOException("The file cannot be opened. It might be locked by another application.", ex)

    Workbook workbook;
    OpenFileDialog openFileDialog = new OpenFileDialog();
    if (openFileDialog.ShowDialog() == true)
    {
        try
        {
            string extension = Path.GetExtension(openFileDialog.File.Name);
            using (Stream input = openFileDialog.File.OpenRead())
            {
                workbook = WorkbookFormatProvidersManager.Import(extension, input);
            }
        }
        catch (IOException ex)
        {
            throw new IOException("The file cannot be opened. It might be locked by another application.", ex);
        }
    }
{{endregion}}



#### __VB__

{{region radspreadprocessing-formats-and-conversion-format-providers-manager_4}}
    Dim openFileDialog As New OpenFileDialog()
    openFileDialog.Filter = FileDialogsHelper.GetOpenFileDialogFilter()
    If openFileDialog.ShowDialog() = True Then
        Try
            Dim extension As String = Path.GetExtension(openFileDialog.File.Name);
            Using input As Stream = openFileDialog.File.OpenRead())
                editor.Owner.Workbook = WorkbookFormatProvidersManager.Import(extension, input)
            End Using
        Catch ex As IOException
            Throw New IOException("The file cannot be opened. It might be locked by another application.", ex)
        End Try
    End If
{{endregion}}

{% endif %}

You can achieve the same result through using the __OpenFile__ command. In fact, the command executes exactly the same code as above. That said, make sure you register the format providers you would like to use before using the command.
        

## Export

The format providers manager contains an __Export()__ method that takes three arguments: the workbook that is to be exported, a string that specified the extension of the saved file, and a Stream that will contain the data. The method attempts to find a provider that can handle a file of the specified extension and if such a provider is registered, the file is saved. If the manager does not have an appropriate registered provider, an __UnsupportedFileFormatException__ is raised.
        

The next example illustrates how to use the __Export()__ method to save a file. The sample code presents the user with the SaveFileDialog. Note that here again you can use the __GetOpenFileDialogFilter()__ method of the __FileDialogHelper__ class to construct the correct filter for all registered format providers.
        

#### __C#__

{{region radspreadprocessing-formats-and-conversion-format-providers-manager_3}}
    SaveFileDialog saveFileDialog = new SaveFileDialog();

    if (saveFileDialog.ShowDialog() == true)
    {
        string extension = Path.GetExtension(saveFileDialog.SafeFileName);
        using (Stream output = saveFileDialog.OpenFile())
        {
            WorkbookFormatProvidersManager.Export(workbook, extension, output);
        }
    }
{{endregion}}



#### __VB__

{{region radspreadprocessing-formats-and-conversion-format-providers-manager_3}}
    Dim saveFileDialog As New SaveFileDialog()
    saveFileDialog.Filter = FileDialogsHelper.GetSaveFileDialogFilter()

    If saveFileDialog.ShowDialog() = True Then
        Dim extension As String = Path.GetExtension(saveFileDialog.SafeFileName)
        Using output As Stream = saveFileDialog.OpenFile()
            WorkbookFormatProvidersManager.Export(workbook, extension, output)
        End Using
    End If
{{endregion}}



You can achieve the same result through using the __SaveFile__ command. In fact, the command executes exactly the same code as above. That said, make sure you register the format providers you would like to use before using the command.
        

## Retrieve Registered Providers and Supported Extensions

The __WorkbookFormatProvidersManager__ class offers several approaches to retrieve the registered format providers. The class offers the GetProviderByName() static method that searches through the registered providers to find a provider with a specific name. Also, the manager exposes the __GetProvderByExtension extension. The class also contains a static method __xGetSupportedExtensions()__ that returns an IEnumeable of the currently supported file extensions.
