# Scrolling



## 

__RadTreeListView__ provides two scrolling modes, which allow you to manipulate the type of scrolling. This is controlled by the __ScrollMode__ enumeration property which has the following entries:
		

* __RealTime__ - updates the content in view in real time as the user scrolls.
			

* __Deferred__ - keeps the content in view static until scrolling is complete.
			

By default the __ScrollMode__ property is set to the __RealTime__ mode.
		

As __RadTreeListView__ directly inherits the __RadGridView__ it uses its scrolling mechanism. __RadGridView__ allows you to implement programmatic scrolling. To learn more read the
		  [Scroll to a particular row or column]({%slug gridview-scroll-item%}) article in __RadGridView's__ documentation.
