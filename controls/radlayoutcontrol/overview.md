## Key Features

* __Complex layouts__: With RadLayoutControl you can create complex compositions that can be easily rearranged and resized according to the available size of the control.

* __Runtime layout customization__: You can customize the layout at any given point in time while the application is running. You can rearrange the items, delete, resize, etc. You can read more about this in the [Edit the Layout]({%slug radlayoutcontrol-edit-the-layout%}) help article.

* __Items nesting__: You can nest layout items inside one another which gives you very flexible control over the arrangement of the layout.

* __Layout groups__: The control provides you with few types of layout groups which have different visual representation. You can read more about this feature in the [Layout Groups]({%slug radlayoutcontrol-features-layoutgroups-overview%}) section in the documentation.

* __Save and load the layout__: This feature allows you to save the current state of the layout. You can read more about it in the [Save/Load Layout]({%slug radlayoutcontrol-features-save-load-layout%}) help article.

* __Toolbox__: The toolbox allows you to easily add items to the layout via drag/drop. You can also use it to keep track of the deleted items, and the hierarchical structure of the layout. You can read more about this in the [ToolBox]({%slug radlayoutcontrol-features-toolbox-overview%}) documentation section.
