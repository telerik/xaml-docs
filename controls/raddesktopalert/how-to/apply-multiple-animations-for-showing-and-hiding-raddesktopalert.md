# {{ site.framework_name }} RadDesktopAlert How to apply multiple animations for showing and hiding RadDesktopAlert

Using the __ShowAnimation__ and __HideAnimation__ properties of the __DesktopAlertManager__ you could easily apply an animation or group of animations that all __RadDesktopAlert__ instances will use to show and hide. Both properties are of type __RadAnimation__ and only animations that inherits and extents that class could be set to them. __RadAnimation__ class also provides the ability to use some the common animation properties like __SpeedRatio__ and __AnimationName__.

This is the list of the several build-in animations you could apply:

* FadeAnimation

* ResizeAnimation

* ScaleAniamation

* SlideAnimation

* MoveAnimation

You could either set a single animation to the __ShowAnimation__ and __HideAnimation__ properties or use the __AnimationGroup__ to group several animations from the list above and play them simultaneously.

>To learn more about the methods and properties exposed by the API for each of the other animations mentioned above take a look at [this topic](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/wpf/api/telerik.windows.controls.animation).

## Applying AnimationGroup

Using the __AnimationGroup__ class you could group animations and play them simultaneously. You could easily add or remove animation objects of this composite animation using its __Children__ property that is of type __IList__. 

The next code snippet shows how to apply an __AnimationGroup__ to both the __ShowAnimation__ and __HideAnimation__ properties of __DesktopAlertManager__:

#### __[C#] Applying AnimationGroup__

{{region cs-raddesktopalert-how-to-apply-animation-group_1}}
	AnimationGroup groupIn = new AnimationGroup();
	groupIn.Children.Add(new FadeAnimation() { Direction = AnimationDirection.In });
	groupIn.Children.Add(new ScaleAnimation() { Direction = AnimationDirection.In, MinScale = 0.9 });
	AnimationGroup groupOut = new AnimationGroup();
	groupOut.Children.Add(new FadeAnimation() { Direction = AnimationDirection.Out });
	groupOut.Children.Add(new ScaleAnimation() { Direction = AnimationDirection.Out, MinScale = 0.9 });
	this.AnimationGroupManager.ShowAnimation = groupIn;
	this.AnimationGroupManager.HideAnimation = groupOut;
{{endregion}}

#### __[VB] Applying AnimationGroup__

{{region vb-raddesktopalert-how-to-apply-animation-group_1}}
	Dim groupIn As New AnimationGroup()
	groupIn.Children.Add(New FadeAnimation() With {.Direction = AnimationDirection.[In]})
	groupIn.Children.Add(New ScaleAnimation() With {.Direction = AnimationDirection.[In], .MinScale = 0.9})
	Dim groupOut As New AnimationGroup()
	groupOut.Children.Add(New FadeAnimation() With {.Direction = AnimationDirection.Out})
	groupOut.Children.Add(New ScaleAnimation() With {.Direction = AnimationDirection.Out, .MinScale = 0.9})
	Me.AnimationGroupManager.ShowAnimation = groupIn
	Me.AnimationGroupManager.HideAnimation = groupOut
{{endregion}}
