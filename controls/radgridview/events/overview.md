* __DataLoaded__: Occurs when the grid view data is loaded. The type of the passed event arguments is {% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}__System.EventArgs__{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}__GridViewDataLoadingEventArgs__{% endif %}. The event is raised when the control is first bound, when its **ItemsSource** is changed,when a [TableDefinition]({%slug gridview-basic-hierarchies%}#defining-the-gridviewtabledefinition) is updated or when a data operation (such as sorting, filtering and/or grouping) is performed.
