## Key Features:        

* __Visual Expression Building__: With the extremely intuitive UI, __RadDataFilter__ is very user-friendly. Select your filter options with a simple point-and-click. The control allows specifying expressions based on the data and collection type of the source. You can build complex expressions on multiple fields with And/Or operators and a myriad of filter functions.

* __Seamless Integration__: __RadDataFilter__ can communicate with any kind of collection (even a plain IEnumerable). An ItemsControl (RadGridView, RadTreeListView, RadComboBox, RadTreeView etc.) can then be bound to the filtered endpoint called __FilteredSource__. This allows extreme flexibility and loose coupling.

* __Unbound Mode__: The RadDataFilter control allows you to use its UI without passing any data to it. Read more about this in the [Unbound Mode]({%slug raddatafilter-features-unbound-mode%}) article.

* __Build Complex Filter Criteria__: You can easily build filter criteria that contain multiple logical (Boolean) operators combining simple filter conditions. Read more about this in the [End User Manual]({%slug datafilter-end-user-manual%}) article.
