# Working with Data

In this article we will discuss the following topics:

* [Loading Data](#loading-data)

* [Displaying Data](#loading-data)

* [Managing Data](#loading-data)

## Loading Data

You can load data in six distinct ways to be displayed in __RadGridView__ :

* [Using in-memory Data]({%slug gridview-in-memory-date%})

* [From XML]({%slug gridview-loading-data-from-xml%})
 
* [From WCF Services]({%slug gridview-loading-data-from-wcf-services%})

* [From ADO.NET Services]({%slug gridview-loading-data-from-adonet-services%})

{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}

* [From RIA Services]({%slug gridview-loading-data-from-ria-services%})

* [From Web Services]({%slug gridview-loading-data-from-web-services%})
{% endif %}

## Displaying Data

After you've acquired your data, you have to set it as the __ItemsSource__ of your RadGridView instance. The ItemsSource property recognizes any collection that implements **IEnumerable**.

>For RadGridView to correctly respond to changes in your collection when you add or remove items through code-behind, and update the UI accordingly, you must ensure that the source collection implements the **INotifyCollectionChanged** interface. 

__Example 1: Setting RadGridView's ItemsSource__

	```C#
	this.RadGridView.ItemsSource = SampleData.GetData();
```
```VB.NET
	Me.RadGridView.ItemsSource = SampleData.GetData()
```

Once you set the __ItemsSource__ , RadGridView displays the data in columns, which  are auto-generated by default. If you want, you can set RadGridView's **AutoGenerateColumns** property to **False** and [manually create them]({%slug gridview-columns-defining-columns%}#manual-columns-definition). You can find more information regarding RadGridView columns in [the following topic]({%slug gridview-columns-defining-columns%}).

If you don't want to display all the data in one row you can use RadGridView's [Row Details]({%slug radgridview-row-details-overview%}) functionality to display additional information.

If the data you want to display is hierarchical you can display it in nested __RadGridViews__. You can learn more about creating a **Hierarchical GridView** in [the following topic]({%slug gridview-hierachy-overview%}). 

>important Resetting the __ItemsSource__ collection will cause __RadGridView's__ horizontal scrollbar to be set to the top. You can keep track of the scrollbar's **VerticalOffset** and reposition the scrollbar after the collection update to keep the original appearance.

## Managing Data

RadGridView comes with out-of-the-box support for __Insert__, __Update__ and __Delete__ operations, as well as for [data validation]({%slug gridview-managing-data-validation%}).

You can find more information about [managing data]({%slug gridview-managing-data-overview%}) in the following topics:

* [Adding New Entries]({%slug gridview-managing-data-add-new-entries%})

* [Updating an Entry]({%slug gridview-managing-data-updating-entry%})

* [Deleting an Entry]({%slug gridview-managing-data-deleting-entry%})

* [Data Validation]({%slug gridview-managing-data-validation%})
