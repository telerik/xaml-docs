# {{ site.framework_name }} RadColorEditor Events Overview

This topic covers the specific events exposed by the __RadColorEditor__ control. 

* __SelectedColorChanging__ - raised while the __SelectedColor__ property is changing its value. The __SelectedColorChanging__ event handler receives two arguments: 
	* The sender argument contains the __RadColorEditor__. This argument is of type __object__, but can be cast to the __RadColorEditor__ type. 
	* A __ColorChangeEventArgs__ object. You can use it to find the color that is getting selected through the __Color__ property. Or you can use it to handle the event by setting the __Handled__ property to __True__ thus canceling the selection.
