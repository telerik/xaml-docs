# Populating with Data

There are several ways to populate a treeview with treeview items and they are:

* [Declaratively]({%slug radtreeview-populating-with-data-declaratively%}) in your XAML code - suitable for cases when the treeview items structure is known during the implementation phase and does not change in time.

* [Programmatically]({%slug radtreeview-populating-with-data-in-code-behind%}) from the code-behind____- use when the treeview structure can be changed during run-time by the user or other application logic.

* Using [data binding]({%slug radtreeview-populating-with-data-data-binding-to-xml%}) - use when the treeview structure is described in data module.

Each one of the approaches described above is applicable for certain cases and thatâ€™s why you have to choose the one that best fits your requirements.

>tip Bear in mind that the XAML file is the best place to declare your user interface; use the code-behind only when you cannot do that in XAML.
