This topic describes the work flow for editing an appointment in __RadScheduleView__ control.

* In order to edit an appointment just double click it in the __RadScheduleView__.

* If the appointment is not a recurrent one, the edit appointment dialog appears immediately. 

* After the edit appointment dialog is opened, you can change the Subject, Description, Start and End time of the appointment.

* You can also change or assign category, time marker or importance by using the tool bar controls.

* You can also change the appointment recurrent.

* If you have completed the appointment edit, click the 'Save & Close' button or press the __Enter__ key.

* If you want to cancel the appointment creation, click the X button or press the __Esc__ key.

## Using code

You can edit an appointment using the code. Here are the steps to accomplish this:

1. Call __BeginEdit()__ method of the __RadScheduleView__ control. It returns whether or not  the appointment or the occurrence can be edited. This method has 3 overloads:
          

1. If __BeginEdit()__ returns __True__ - edit the appointment or the occurrence.
          

1. Call __Commit()__ method to commit the changes and to update the __UI__.
