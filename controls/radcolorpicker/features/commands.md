# {{ site.framework_name }} RadColorPicker Commands

This topic covers the commands available in __RadColorPicker__. Commanding is a way to invoke some code in the ViewModels when a user interaction is performed instead of invoking a code behind function.

## Command

__RadColorPicker__ provides __Command__ property of type __ICommand__ which can be bound to Command from your ViewModels / Business Objects. This Command is executed in the following cases:        				

1. User clicks the left part of the SplitButton (the "A" - like RadButton in the SplitButton)

2. User clicks on a non-selected RadColorPaletteViewItem.

>Please note that the Command __will not be executed__ when the user clicks on the Toggle Button (the right part of the SplitButton).

Clicking an already selected color __will not trigger__ the Command too.

>__Command__ is also a property of the __RadColorSelector__. It is triggered when the user clicks a non-selected color from the ColorSelector. Among with Command, RadColorPicker and RadColorSelector provide the standard accompanying properties: __CommandParameter__ and __CommandTarget__.
