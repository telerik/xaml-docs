# {{ site.framework_name }} RadScheduleView Set Today

The scheduleview control allows you to easily navigate to the current day. You can do this via the *Today* button shown in __Figure 1__ or by executing the __RadScheduleViewCommands.SetToday__ command.

## Showing the Today button

The *Today* button is hidden by default. To show it in the [navigation header]({%slug radscheduleview-getting-started-visual-structure%}) you can set the __TodayButtonVisibility__ property.

#### __[XAML] Example 1: Showing the Today button__
{{region radscheduleview-viewdefinition-set-today-0}}
	<telerik:RadScheduleView TodayButtonVisibility="Visible" />
{{endregion}}
