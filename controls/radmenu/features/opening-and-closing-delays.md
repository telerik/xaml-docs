# {{ site.framework_name }} RadMenu Opening and Closing Delays

The __RadMenu__ allows you to specify delays for its closing and opening actions. This means that you can make the __RadMenu__ wait for a specific amount of time before opening or closing a menu. In order to specify these delays you can set the __ShowDelay__ and __HideDelay__ properties. They are of type __Duration__ and have the following format in XAML "0:0:0.00".

>Note that when the __ClickToOpen__ property is set to __True__, the delays don't affect the __RadMenu's__ behavior.

Here is an example of a __RadMenu__ with a delay before opening a menu equal to one second and a delay before closing a menu also equal to one second.

#### __XAML__

{{region xaml-radmenu-features-opening-and-closing-delays_0}}
	<telerik:RadMenu VerticalAlignment="Top"
	                 ShowDelay="0:0:1"
	                 HideDelay="0:0:1">
	    ...
	</telerik:RadMenu>
{{endregion}}
