# Coded UI support

The purpose of this section is to show you how to create a simple CodedUI test. 

>tipFor more information about Creating, Editing and Maintaining a Coded UI Test check out the official page in MSDN [here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff977233.aspx).        

In order to create a CodedUI test, you need to perform the following steps:

* Add the __Telerik.VisualStudio.TestTools.UITest.Extension.ExtensionsCore__ assembly into the following directory:          

	* For Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 - "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\VSTT\\__10.0__\UITestExtensionPackages".              

	* For Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 - "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\VSTT\\__11.0__\UITestExtensionPackages".              

* You will find the following folders in your UI for WPF installation folder - (usually C:\Program Files\Telerik\UI for WPF [version]\Binaries\WPF40\\__TestTools__).          

* The __Telerik.VisualStudio.TestTools.UITest.Extension.ExtensionsCore__ assembly must be installed into the global assembly cache (GAC). You can achieve this using the [Global Assembly Cache Tool (Gacutil.exe)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ex0ss12c(v=vs.80).aspx).          

* Create WPF Project with the control you want to test.

* Add a new TestProject.

* Add new item to TestProject - Coded UI Test. The __Generate Code for Coded UI Test__ dialog box appears.          

* Select the __Record actions, edit UI map or add assertions__ option and choose __OK__. For more information about the options in the dialog box, you could check [this](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd286726.aspx) article.          

* Record a sequence of actions.

* Verify the values in UI properties.

* Run the test.

Below you can find information about the supported level of CodedUI tests throughout our controls.
