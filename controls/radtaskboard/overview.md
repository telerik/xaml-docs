## Key Features:

* __TaskBoardCardModel__: RadTaskBoard control provides build-in ViewModel class which exposes the most required properties that allow you to track your task life cycle. This class can serve as a base class for the __RadTaskBoardCard__ element.

* __Category Indicator__: Using colors is a quick way to make tasks stand out on the board. It helps users to quickly identify priority, type of work or an assignee as well as to group tasks for further reporting using the color criteria.

* __Tags__: You can highlight given tasks by adding tags to their Tags collection. Adding tags can be a great way to associate items with a release, sub-tasks to a story, feature, or project, etc. 

* __Drag-Drop Support__: Users can easily reorder tasks between their life cycle.  

* __Selection__: The control supports task selection. 

* __Styling and Appearance__: RadTaskBoard comes with a variety of themes and properties that allow you to enhance the control's appearance.

* __Touch Support__: The RadTaskBoard control also provides out-of-the-box touch support.
