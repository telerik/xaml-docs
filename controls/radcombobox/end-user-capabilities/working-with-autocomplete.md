# Working with AutoComplete



## 

This topic describes the end-user's workflow for using the __AutoComplete__ feature of the __RadComboBox__.

>

In order for the user to be able to use this feature of the __RadComboBox__, its __IsEditable__ property has to be set to __True__.

The first thing to do is to click in the editable part of the __RadComboBox__.
