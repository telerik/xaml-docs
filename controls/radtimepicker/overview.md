# {{ site.framework_name }} RadTimePicker Overview

Thank you for choosing __Telerik RadTimePicker__! 

__RadTimePicker__ is a convenient way to get rid of boring time parsing and data validation. RadTimePicker is an easy and simple, but yet essential control to improve end-user experience. Moreover, you can control the layout of the popup that shows time values as well as to use the rich data model in {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %} Silverlight {% endif %} {% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %} WPF
{% endif %} to populate content dynamically.

{% if site.has_cta_panels == true %}
{% include cta-panel-overview.html %}
{% endif %}

## Key Features

The RadTimePicker control derives from the RadDateTimePicker control and inherits most of its features. This is a list with short descriptions of the top-of-the-line features of the Telerik __RadTimePicker__ control:        

* __Powerful Data-binding__: The {{ site.framework_name }} __RadTimePicker__ control can be bound to various datasource types, such as Object, XML and WCF services.          

* __Keyboard Navigation__: __RadTimePicker__ supports the standard browser navigation paradigm. Once the control has focus, you can press the **Down Arrow** key to show the calendar. The users can go forward/backward over the individual times by pressing the arrow keys. Pressing the **ESC** button will close the picker.

* __Advanced Parser__: You can enter any number or string in the input field of __RadTimePicker__ and the entered value will be transformed to a valid time.

* __Styling and Appearance__: __RadTimePicker__ can be fully customized. There are also several pre-defined themes that can be used to style the control. [Read more]({%slug raddatetimepicker-styling-overview%})

* __Enhanced Routed Events Framework__: To help your code become even more elegant and concise, we implemented an Enhanced Routed Events Framework for the controls from the __UI for {{ site.framework_name }}__ suite.  This gives you more freedom when you design your applications since you can write instance handlers as well as class handlers for the routed events of our controls.

* __Watermark__: The __TimePicker__ control allows the user to define and use watermarks in the time field. [Read more]({%slug raddatetimepicker-features-watermark%})
