# Overview

![FileDialogs WPF Icon](images/FileDialogs_WPF_Icon.png)

Whenever you open or save a file in almost any Windows application, you will see roughly the same dialogs for doing so. As of **R3 2017** you can keep the UI appearance throughout your application consistent with the new file dialogs provided by the **Telerik UI for WPF** suite.

Apart from support of all predefined themes of the suite, the controls provide most of the functionality of the standard MS dialogs while leaving room for further customization.

## Key Features

Here are a few of the controls' main features:

* **Easy Navigation**: The dialogs allow you to easily browse through your file system either through the **tree-view-like navigation pane** or the **breadcrumb/path pane**. A **history** of the visited folders is kept so that you can seamlessly jump back and forth between folders.

* **Search**: The out-of-the-box search functionality allows you to quickly find just the files and folders you're looking for by using the **Windows Search index** when available.

* **Customizable Layouts**: The controls also provide you with an API to set an **InitialDirectory**, specify **custom folders** to be displayed top-most in the navigation pane and switch between **different view modes** (Tiles, Small Icons, Large Icons, etc.).

* **Variety of Themes**: You can persist the appearance throughout your application by applying any of the **predefined themes** provided by the UI for WPF suite to your dialogs.

* **Keyboard Navigation Support**: You can easily navigate through the **tree-view-like navigation pane**, the **breadcrumb/path pane** and the files in all layouts by just pressing the arrow keys on your keyboard.

* **Windows File System Synchronization**: The dialogs provide seemless synchronization with the Windows File System. Adding, renaming or deleting operations on files are reflected in the dialogs instantly. 

* **New Folder Functionality**: You can add a new folder in all dialogs with the **New Folder** button.

* **Context Menu**: The dialogs use the well-known Windows context menu. 

* **Editing**: The controls provide file and folder names editing via the F2 key or mouse click.

* **Touch Support**: The dialogs also provide out-of-the-box touch support.

* **Drive/Directory Filtering**: You can filter all drives and directories with the **DirectoryRequesting** event.

* **Codeless Тest Аutomation**: You can record, execute and debug functional tests for the controls without leaving the familiar Visual Studio environment.
 
The file dialogs also support many other features of the native Windows file dialogs.
