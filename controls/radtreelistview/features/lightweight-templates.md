# Lightweight Templates



## 

As of __2013 Q2 SP__ we have introduced __Lightweight Templates__ for RadGridView and RadTreeListView. Their main idea is to limit the number of visual elements within the templates in order to speed up the performance of the control. More information on how to apply them into your project can be found in
          [the respective RadGridView's topic]({%slug gridview-overview-lightweight-template%}).
