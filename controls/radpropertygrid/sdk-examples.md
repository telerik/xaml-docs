# SDK Examples



The [Telerik XAML SDK repository](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/) provides additional demos for most of the Telerik UI for {% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %} controls. The examples demonstrate many specific user case scenarios, that might be really helpful. In this article you can find the complete list of all SDK examples for __RadPropertyGrid__.

## List of all RadPropertyGrid SDK examples:{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}

* __AutoBind Attached Behavior__ - 
The need of reusable DataTemplates is a common scenario with quite few universal viable solutions. 
The AutoBind attached behavior enables RadPropertyGrid to use a single DataTemplate resource as an EditorTemplate value for multiple PropertyDefinitions without any additional effort on the users' side.

* __CollectionEditor__ - 
 is editor control that provide UI for editing collections and their items.

* __Combobox editor for Boolean property__ - This example demonstrates how to show Combobox as an editor of Boolean property.

* __Custom ToolTip in PropertyGridField__ - This example demonstrates how to add a custom ToolTip with Hiperlink in PropertyGridField.

* __Custom Keyboard Command Provider__ -  RadPropertyGrid provides an easy MVVM-friendly approach for customization of its default commands' logic. This example demonstrates how to extend the way RadPropertyGrid handles a particular key.

* __Edit Modes__ - 
RadPropertyGrid exposes an EditMode property of type PropertyGridEditMode, which provides different options for editing behavior.

* __Editor Attribute__ - 
RadPropertyGrid provides support for the new Telerik attribute - EditorAttribute that enables the user to define an editor for each property directly in its definition.

* __FlagEnumEditor__ - 
RadPropertyGrid supports editing bit flag enum by exposing a new editor – . It enables the user to store any combination of the values that are defined in the enumerator list

* __Show Tooltip for GroupName__ - 
This example demonstrates how to show a tooltip for PropertyGridField's GroupName.

* __ReadOnlyEditorState__ - 
 property represents RadPropertyGrid's read only behavior.

* __ReadOnly PropertyDefinition__ - 
This example demonstrates how to control which property definitions to be read only.

* __ScrollIntoViewAsync__ - 
This example demonstrates how to scroll to a particular PropertyDefinition and selecting it.

* __Validation__ - 
RadPropertyGrid supports validation through IDataErrorInfo and also through DataAnnotations. This example demonstrates how to implement such validation.{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}
