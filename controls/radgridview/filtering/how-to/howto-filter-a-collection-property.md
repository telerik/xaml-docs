# {{ site.framework_name }} RadGridView Filter a Collection Property

By default, RadGridView will not be able to filter properties which are **IEnumerable**. However, with two of its features you can easily add this functionality - a custom [ColumnFilterDescriptor]({%slug gridview-filtering-programmatic%}) and a [custom column]({%slug gridview-add-button-column%}) to use this descriptor.

A working example with the implementation of this requirement can be found in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/GridView/FilteringCollectionProperties). You can also run this example using the [SDK Samples Browser](https://demos.telerik.com/xaml-sdkbrowser/) application.
