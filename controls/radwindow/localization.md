# {{ site.framework_name }} RadWindow Localization

The built-in localization mechanism in {{ site.framework_name }} allows you to localize any string resource used by the standard __RadWindow__ control. Once translated you might use your resources in {{ site.framework_name }} projects without changing anything.

>tip To learn more about the ways in which to localize the RadControls please read the common topic about [Localization]({%slug common-localization%}).

## Supported Languages

__RadWindow__ can be translated in one of the following supported languages using the frameworkâ€™s localization mechanism:

* English
* German
* Spanish
* French
* Italian
* Dutch
* Turkish

## Resource Keys

This section lists the unique localization string identifiers, called resource keys. They are used in the RadWindow control to define the localization string's key and translation.
