# {{ site.framework_name }} RadGauge Marker

The Marker is a scale indicator that points to a value along a scale. It is a small shape that can be located around the scale bar. To add marker to the scale you have to include Marker element to the list of the scale indicators:

#### __XAML__
{{region linear-scale-marker_0}}
	<telerik:RadHorizontalLinearGauge Width="250" Height="100" telerik:StyleManager.Theme="Windows8">
	    <telerik:HorizontalLinearScale Min="0" Max="100">
	        <telerik:HorizontalLinearScale.Indicators>
	            <telerik:Marker  Value="75"
	                             telerik:ScaleObject.Offset="0.02*"
	                             telerik:ScaleObject.RelativeWidth="0.03*"
	                             telerik:ScaleObject.RelativeHeight="0.08*" 
	                             telerik:ScaleObject.Location="OverOutside" />
	        </telerik:HorizontalLinearScale.Indicators>
