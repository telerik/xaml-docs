# {{ site.framework_name }} RadGridView Clipboard Overview

![{{ site.framework_name }} RadGridView Copy Paste Clipboard](images/RadGridView_ClipboardOperations.png)



Introduced in __Q2 2010__ (2010.2.714), the revamped clipboard capabilities of __RadGridView__ allow users to copy and paste between __RadGridView__ and other applications on your computer or another __RadGridView__. Developers have a fine-grained control over [Copying]({%slug gridview-copying%}) and [Pasting]({%slug gridview-pasting%}) through a number of properties and events.
