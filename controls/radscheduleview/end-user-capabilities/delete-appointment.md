# {{ site.framework_name }} RadScheduleView Delete Appointment

This topic describes the work flow for deleting an appointment in __RadScheduleView__ control.

## Using UI

* In order to delete an appointment in the __RadScheduleView__ you can either select it and press __Del__ key or hover your mouse over it and click the delete key that appears in the upper right corner of the appointment.

* If the appointment you are trying to delete is single one and is not part of any recurrence, a simple confirmation dialog appears asking you to confirm the deletion. Click 'OK' to confirm the deletion or 'Cancel' to stop it.

* If the appointment is part of a recurrence series, a more complex confirmation dialog appears asking you what do you want to delete.

* You can choose between two options:

* __'Delete this occurrence'__ - delete only this specific occurrence of the whole series.

* __'Delete the series'__ - delete all appointments that belong to this series.

Select the option you wish and click 'OK' to confirm the deletion or 'Cancel' to stop it.

## Using code

You can delete an appointment using the code. Just Call __Remove()__ method of the __RadScheduleView__ control. It returns whether or not  the appointment or the occurrence can be removed. This method has 2 overloads:

#### __C#__

{{region radscheduleview-end-user-capabilities-delete-appointment_0}}
	this.radScheduleView.Remove(appointment);
{{endregion}}

#### __XAML__

{{region radscheduleview-end-user-capabilities-delete-appointment_1}}
	Me.radScheduleView.Remove(appointment)
{{endregion}}
