# {{ site.framework_name }} RadUpload Template Structure



Like most {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %} controls, the __RadUpload__ also allows you to template it in order to change the control from the inside. Except for templating the whole control, you can template parts of it or even independent controls related to it. This topic will make you familiar with the:

* [RadUpload Template Structure](#RadUpload_Template_Structure)

* [RadUploadItem Template Structures](#RadUploadItem_Template_Structure)

>tipFor more information about templating and how to modify the default templates of the __RadControls__ read [the common topics](http://www.telerik.com/help/silverlight/common-styling-appearance-edit-control-templates-blend.html) on this matter.
