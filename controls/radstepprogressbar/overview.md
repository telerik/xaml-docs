# {{ site.framework_name }} StepProgressBar Overview

__RadStepProgressBar__ enables you to setup a visual element that displays a multi-step process via number of different steps and a progress track bar between each step. Selecting a step will animate a progress movement from the previously selected step to the new one.

## Key Features

* __Easily customizable visuals__: The track bar and each step of the control can be customized by changing their default properties (like color and size) or by replacing the default visualization with a custom one. Read more it the [Appearance]({%slug stepprogressbar-appearance-step%}) section of the documentation.

* __Data binding support__: RadStepProgressBar comes with built-in data binding support which allows you to provide a collection of any objects that can store information for each step. Read more in the [Data Binding]({%slug stepprogressbar-data-binding%}) article.

* __Horizontal and vertical orientations__: The control is arranged horizontally by default (left to right). Additionally, the control can be arranged vertically (top to bottom or bottom to top). Read more in the [Layout]({%slug stepprogressbar-layout%}) article.

* __Selection__: The steps in the progress bar can be selected in code or via click in the UI. Read more about the available API in the [Selection]({%slug stepprogressbar-selection%}) article.

* __Additional content__: Each step can display content on top and bottom of its visual element. The contents are optional and fully customizable. Read more in the [Step Item Contents]({%slug stepprogressbar-step-contents%}) article.
