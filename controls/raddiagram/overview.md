# {{ site.framework_name }} Diagram Overview

Thank you for choosing __RadDiagram__!		

The __RadDiagram__ control and its components allow you to create flexible and interactive diagramming layouts for your rich data-visualization application. The diagram toolset enables you to:

* Design workflows in which case shapes and connections are tightly bound to an underlying API.
* Simulate processes and represent data logic.
* Architect data-visualization and data analysis Diagramming structures.
* Further enhance and customize your geographic maps solutions.

## Key Features

* __Powerful data binding support__: The diagramming framework supports data binding to objects and collections out-of-the-box. Read more about this in the [Populating with Data]({%slug raddiagram-data-overview%}) section.

* __Extensive set of diagramming shapes__: The diagramming framework exposes a set of predefined diagramming shapes. Read more about this in the [Diagram Items]({%slug raddiagrams-features-shapes%}) section.

* __Flexible diagramming connections__: The diagramming framework exposes flexible diagram connections. Read more about this in the [Diagram Items]({%slug raddiagrams-features-connections%}) section.

* __Items editing__: The diagramming framework supports editing the content of the diagramming elements. Read more about this in the [Items Editing]({%slug raddiagrams-features-edit%}) article.

* __Items rotation__: The diagramming framework supports rotation. Read more about this in the [Rotation]({%slug raddiagrams-features-rotation%}) article.

* __Items resizing__: The diagramming framework supports resizing. Read more about this in the [Resizing]({%slug raddiagrams-features-resizing%}) artcle.

* __Items ZOrder__: The diagramming framework supports changing the z-order of its elements. Read more about this in the [ZOrder]({%slug raddiagrams-features-zorder%}) article.

* __Items selection__: The diagramming framework allows users to select one or multiple diagram elements at any time. Read more about this in the [Selection]({%slug raddiagrams-features-selection%})

* __Clipboard operations__: The diagramming framework supports __cut__, __copy__ and __paste__ operations. Read more about this in the [Clipboard Operations]({%slug raddiagrams-features-clipboard%}) article.

* __Pan and zoom__: The diagramming framework supports __pan__ and __zoom__ operations. Read more about this in the [Pan and Zoom]({%slug raddiagrams-features-pan-zoom%}) article.

* __Undo and redo__: The diagramming framework supports __undo__ and __redo__ operations. Read more about this in the [Undo and Redo]({%slug raddiagrams-features-undo-redo%}) article.

* __Align and Snap To Grid__: The diagramming framework allows you to easily _align the diagramming items__ and it also supports __snap-to-grid__ operations. read more about this in the [Align and Snap]({%slug raddiagrams-features-snap%}) article.

* __Read-Only diagram__: The diagramming framework allows you to create read-only diagramming structures but still keep the events and selections active thus allowing you to keep the interactivity of the solution. Read more about this in the [Read-Only Diagram]({%slug raddiagrams-features-read-only%}) article.

* __Virtualization__: The diagramming framework supports __UI Virtualization__, which collapses all items outside the viewable area, thus, enhancing additionally the UI performance while manipulating the diagramming elements. Read more about this in the [Virtualization]({%slug raddiagrams-features-virtualization%}) article.

* __Serialization__: The diagramming framework supports serializing and deserializing Diagramming objects into and from XML documents. Read more about this in the [Serialization]({%slug raddiagrams-features-serialization%}) article.

* __Mouse tools__: The diagramming framework exposes a set of mouse tools - selection, connection and pan tools. Read more about this in the [Mouse Tools]({%slug raddiagrams-features-mouse-tools%}) article.
