Thank you for choosing Telerik __RadAutoCompleteBox__!

__RadAutoCompleteBox__ is a {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %} control that provides a textbox for the users input and suggests possible matches based on that input. The control has a number of advanced features like autocomplete mode, keyboard navigation, virtualization for working with thousands of items in its ItemsSource, as well as full customization capabilities.

Key features:

* __AutoComplete__ â€“ the {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %} RadAutoCompleteBox supports different autocomplete modes - Suggest, Append, SuggestAppend. [Read more.]({%slug radautocompletebox-features-autocomplete%})

* __Silverlight/WPF Code Compatibility__ - the {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %} RadAutoCompleteBox shares a single codebase with its Silverlight WPF counterpart. This means that you can achieve close to 100% code reuse for your RadAutoCompleteBox logic if you have parallel Silverlight/WPF development.

* __Expression Blend support__ - all controls from the UI for {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %} suite can be easily customized using Expression Blend.

* __Keyboard Support__ - the {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %} RadAutoCompleteBox supports several keyboard shortcuts for performing the most common tasks. [Read more.]({%slug radautocompletebox-features-keyboard-support%})
