# {{ site.framework_name }} RadDateTimePicker How to set different culture

In many scenarios it is useful to set a specific Culture in your application that differs from the Culture of the environment. In those cases the easiest and straight forward approach is to set the __CurrentCulture__ and __CurrentUICulture__ to the desired custom __CultureInfo__.

The __RadDateTimePicker__ control uses that Culture in order to parse the input date and time that is added in the TextBox of the control.

## Setting different CurrentCulture and CurrentUICulture

The next code snippet demonstrates how to set the CurrentCulture and CurrentUICulture to US culture:

#### __C#__

{{region cs-raddatetimepicker-how-to-set-culture-1}}
	InitializeComponent();
	
	var culture = new CultureInfo("en-US");
	Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture = culture;
	Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = culture;
{{endregion}}

The next figures show the difference with the custom en-US culture and the normal environment culture (which in this case is bg-BG):

Figure 2. With the normal environment culture

## Setting Custom DateTimeFormat

If you want to customize the patter of the ShortDatePattern and ShortTimePattern all you need to do is:

* Create a CultureInfo object and set it to the desired culture

* Create a DateTimeFormatInfo object and set its ShortDatePattern, ShortTimePattern

* Set newly created CultureInfo to the CurrentCulture and CurrentUICulture

The next code snippet shows how to set the date pattern in order to change the date separator from “/” to “-”:

{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}
>In order for the parsing of the input date to be correct you need to make sure that the __DateSeparator__ is set to the desired symbol in the ShortDatePattern.

#### __C#__

{{region cs-raddatetimepicker-how-to-set-culture-2}}
	InitializeComponent();
	
	var culture = new CultureInfo("en-US");
	var dtfInfo = new DateTimeFormatInfo
	{
	    ShortDatePattern = "MM-dd-yyyy",
	    ShortTimePattern = "HH:mm",
	    DateSeparator = "-"
	};
	culture.DateTimeFormat = dtfInfo;
	Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture = culture;
	Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = culture;
{{endregion}}
{% endif %}

{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}
#### __C#__

{{region cs-raddatetimepicker-how-to-set-culture-3}}
	InitializeComponent();
	
	var culture = new CultureInfo("en-US");
	var dtfInfo = new DateTimeFormatInfo
	{
	    ShortDatePattern = "MM-dd-yyyy",
	    ShortTimePattern = "HH:mm"
	};
	culture.DateTimeFormat = dtfInfo;
	Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture = culture;
	Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = culture;
{{endregion}}
{% endif %}
