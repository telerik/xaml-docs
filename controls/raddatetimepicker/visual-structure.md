# {{ site.framework_name }} RadDateTimePicker Visual Structure

This section defines terms and concepts used in the scope of __RadDateTimePicker__ that you need to get familiar with prior to continue reading this help. They can also be helpful when contacting our support service in order to describe your issue better. Below you can see snapshots and explanations of the main states and visual elements of the standard __RadDateTimePicker__ control.        

The __RadDateTimePicker__ is a user interface control that presents users with an easy and user friendly way to choose a specific date, time or both. The contents can be shown and hidden as the user clicks on a dropdown button. In its default state, the content is collapsed, displaying only an input field as shown in the snapshot below. It is also possible to input data in the date time box by yourself, in which case a nice suggestive preview tooltip is available.
