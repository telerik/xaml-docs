# Getting Started

This tutorial will walk you through the creation of a sample application that contains __RadComboBox__. 

* [Assembly References](#assembly-references)
* [Adding RadComboBox to the Project](#adding-radcombobox-to-the-project)
* [Populating with Data](#populating-with-data)
* [Working with AutoComplete](#working-with-autocomplete)
* [Working with Edit Modes](#working-with-edit-modes)

## Assembly References

In order to use the __RadComboBox__ control in your projects, you have to add references to the following assemblies:			

* __Telerik.Windows.Controls__
* __Telerik.Windows.Controls.Input__

## Adding RadComboBox to the Project

Before proceeding with adding __RadComboBox__ to your project, make sure the required assembly references are added to the project. 

You can add __RadComboBox__ manually by writing the XAML code in __Example 1__. You can also add the control by dragging it from the Visual Studio Toolbox and dropping it over the XAML view.


#### __[XAML] Example 1: Adding RadComboBox in XAML__

{{region combobox-getting-started_0}}
	<telerik:RadComboBox Width="100" />
{{endregion}}


>In order to use __RadComboBox__ in XAML you have to add the namespace declaration shown in __Example 2__:
>#### __[XAML] Example 2: Declaring Telerik Namespace__
>{{region telerik-schemas}}
>    xmlns:telerik="http://schemas.telerik.com/2008/xaml/presentation"
>{{endregion}}

If you run the application you will see an empty ComboBox as demonstrated in __Figure 1__. 

#### __Figure 1: The empty ComboBox generated by the code in Example 1__

## Populating with Data

In order to populate the __RadComboBox__ control with data in XAML, you should add a few __RadComboBoxItems__ to it and set their Content property as in __Example 3__.

#### __[XAML] Example 3: Adding RadComboBoxItems in XAML__

{{region combobox-getting-started_1}}
	<telerik:RadComboBox Width="100">
        <telerik:RadComboBoxItem Content="Item 1" />
        <telerik:RadComboBoxItem Content="Item 2" />
    </telerik:RadComboBox>
{{endregion}}

Running the application will result in a populated __RadComboBox__ as shown in __Figure 2__.

__Figure 2: RadComboBox with static items__

![](images/RadComboBox_GettingStarted_1.png)

Adding static __RadComboBoxItems__ in XAML is good in scenarios when you know in advance the data in the combo box. However, in most cases, you have to bind your __RadComboBox__ to a collection of business objects. For the purposes of this example, create a new class named Car and add several properties to it as shown in __Example 4__.

#### __[C#] Example 4: Simple business class__

{{region combobox-getting-started_2}}  
	public class Car
	{
		public string Make { get; set; }
		public string Model { get; set; }

		public Car(string make, string model)
		{
			this.Make = make;
			this.Model = model;
		}
	} 
{{endregion}}

#### __[VB.NET] Example 4: Simple business class__

{{region combobox-getting-started_2}}  
	Public Class Car
		Public Property Make() As String
			Get
				Return m_Make
			End Get
			Set(value As String)
				m_Make = Value
			End Set
		End Property
		Private m_Make As String

		Public Property Model() As String
			Get
				Return m_Model
			End Get
			Set(value As String)
				m_Model = Value
			End Set
		End Property
		Private m_Model As String

		Public Sub New(make As String, model As String)
			Me.Make = make
			Me.Model = model
		End Sub
	End Class
{{endregion}}

Next, you should create the view model containing a collection of Car objects. 

#### __[C#] Example 5: View model containing ObservableCollection of sample data__
{{region combobox-getting-started_3}}
	public class MyViewModel
	{
		private ObservableCollection<Car> cars;

		public ObservableCollection<Car> Cars
		{
			get
			{
				if (this.cars == null)
				{
					this.cars = this.CreateCars();
				}
				return this.cars;
            }
        }

        private ObservableCollection<Car> CreateCars()
        {
            ObservableCollection<Car> cars = new ObservableCollection<Car>() 
            { 
                new Car("Opel", "Vectra"),
                new Car("Ford", "Focus"),
                new Car("Fiat", "Bravo")
            };      
            return cars;
        }
    }
{{endregion}}

#### __[VB.NET] Example 5: View model containing ObservableCollection of sample data__
{{region combobox-getting-started_3}}
	Public Class MyViewModel
    
		Private m_cars As ObservableCollection(Of Car)

		Public ReadOnly Property Cars() As ObservableCollection(Of Car)
			Get
				If Me.m_cars Is Nothing Then
					Me.m_cars = Me.CreateCars()
				End If
				Return Me.m_cars
			End Get
		End Property

		Private Function CreateCars() As ObservableCollection(Of Car)
			Dim cars As New ObservableCollection(Of Car)() From {
				New Car("Opel", "Vectra"),
				New Car("Ford", "Focus"),
				New Car("Fiat", "Bravo")
			}
			Return cars
		End Function
	End Class
{{endregion}}

Now that you have prepared the needed sample data, it is time to bind __RadComboBox__ to it. For that purpose, you should set the __RadComboBox's ItemsSource__ property to the collection of cars. Additionally, you should set __DisplayMemberPath__ property to mark which property of the business object will be used as its visual representation inside __RadComboBox__.

__Example 6__ demonstrates how you can bind the ItemsSource collection in XAML. The _local_ namespace in the example corresponds to the namespace where __MyViewModel__ resides. 

#### __[XAML] Example 6: Bind RadComboBox__

{{region combobox-getting-started_4}}
    <Grid.Resources>
        <local:MyViewModel x:Key="MyViewModel" />
    </Grid.Resources>
    <telerik:RadComboBox Width="100" DataContext="{StaticResource MyViewModel}" ItemsSource="{Binding Cars}" 
		DisplayMemberPath="Make" />
{{endregion}}

Running the application at this stage will result in a populated __RadComboBox__ like in __Figure 3__.

## Working with AutoComplete

__AutoComplete__ is a feature provided by many browsers, programs and controls. It involves the program predicting a word or phrase that the user wants to type without the user actually typing it in completely. __RadComboBox__ has full autocomplete support - while you type into the input area, the combo box returns the relative match for the currently typed text.

## Working with Edit Modes

The __RadComboBox__ can be editable, allowing the user to type in its text box, or non-editable, where the text box is hidden. In addition, you could make the text box read only in order to keep the editable look but prevent the user from typing. The __RadComboBox__'s API exposes several properties, allowing you to configure these modes. [Read more]({%slug radcombobox-features-edit-modes%})
