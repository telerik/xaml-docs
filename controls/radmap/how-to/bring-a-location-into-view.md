# {{ site.framework_name }} RadMap Bring a Location into View

In order to bring a location point into view, you simply have to set the __Center__ property of the __RadMap__ property. Here is an example:

#### __XAML__
{{region radmap-how-to-bring-a-location-into-view_0}}
	<telerik:RadMap x:Name="radMap"
	                Width="600"
	                Height="480" />
{{endregion}}

#### __C#__
{{region radmap-how-to-bring-a-location-into-view_1}}
	private void BringLocationIntoView( Location desiredLocation )
	{
	    this.radMap.Center = desiredLocation;
	}
{{endregion}}

#### __VB.NET__
{{region radmap-how-to-bring-a-location-into-view_2}}
	Private Sub BringLocationIntoView(ByVal desiredLocation As Location)
		Me.radMap.Center = desiredLocation
	End Sub
{{endregion}}
