## Key Features	

* __MS Office Interface at your Fingertips__: The RibbonView control provides a UI very similar to the one provided by the MS Office ribbon.

* __Automatic Resizing and Minimization__: The ribbon provides built-in mechanisms that allow you to minimize and automatically resize the ribbon content. Read more about this in the [Minimization]({%slug radribbonview-minimization%}) and [Resizing]({%slug radribbonview-resizing%}) articles.

* __Rich Set of Ribbon Specific Controls__: The ribbon control works with special components (buttons, galleries, tabs, groups, etc.). Read more about this in the [Ribbon Controls]({%slug radribbonview-ribbon-tab%}) section.

* __Application Menu, Recent Documents Menu__: The ribbon allows you to open a backstage menu where you can display information related to the content. Read more about this in the [Ribbon Backstage]({%slug radribbonview-ribbon-backstage%}) and [Application Menu]({%slug radribbonview-applicationmenu%}) articles.

* __Quick Access Toolbar__: The quick access toolbar is easily accessible toolbar displayed in the header of the ribbon where you can place buttons for quick actions as print, copy, etc. Read more about this in the [Quick Access Toolbar]({%slug radribbonview-qat%}) article.

* __Screen Tips__: The ribbon allows you to display a small window that appears when the mouse cursor hovers over an icon or a ribbon element (command). The popup window will provide details that explain the command's function. Read more about this in the [Screen Tips]({%slug radribbonview-screentips%}) article.
