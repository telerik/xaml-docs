# Getting Started

This tutorial will walk you through the creation of a sample application that contains __RadWizard__ control.

>In order to use the __RadWizard__ control in your projects you have to add references to the following assemblies:
>* Telerik.Windows.Controls
>*	Telerik.Windows.Controls.Navigation
>{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}*	Telerik.Windows.Data{% endif %} 
>
>You can find more info {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}[here]({%slug installation-installing-controls-dependencies%}){% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}[here]({%slug installation-installing-controls-dependencies-wpf%}){% endif %}  .

For the purpose of this example, you will need to open Visual Studio and then create an empty Application project.

## Adding RadWizard to the Project
You can add __RadWizard__ manually by writing the XAML code in __Example 1__. You can also add the control by dragging it from the Toolbox. 

#### __[XAML]Example 1: Adding a RadWizard manually in XAML__
{{region radwizard-getting-started-0}}
	 <telerik:RadWizard x:Name="radWizard" />
{{endregion}}

>In order to use __RadWizard__ you should define the following namespace:
__xmlns:telerik="http://schemas.telerik.com/2008/xaml/presentation"__
 
Now we can populate __RadWizard__ with some pages.
## Adding pages to RadWizard
 To add pages to __RadWizard__ you have to use its __WizardPages__ collection, which consists of __WizardPage__ elements. Here is an example of defining a page (__Example 2__): 

#### __[XAML]Example 2: Adding a WizardPage manually in XAML__
{{region radwizard-getting-started-1}}
	<Grid>
	<telerik:RadWizard x:Name="radWizard" >
			<telerik:RadWizard.WizardPages>
				<telerik:WizardPage Content="My Wizard Page Content" />
			</telerik:RadWizard.WizardPages>			
		</telerik:RadWizard>
	</Grid>
{{endregion}}

Running the application (__Figure 1__) you will see the wizard page with its content and the page footer that contains all the predefined buttons.
