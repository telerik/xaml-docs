## What is a Template Selector?

The __DataTemplateSelector__ provides a way to apply data templates based on custom logic.

Typically, you use a template selector when you have more than one data template defined for the same type of objects. For example, use it if your binding source is a list of student objects and you want to apply a particular template to the part-time students. You can do this by creating a class that inherits from __DataTemplateSelector__ and by overriding the __SelectTemplate()__ method. Once your class is defined you can assign an instance of the class to the template selector property of your element.
