# {{ site.framework_name }} RadChart Localization


The built-in localization mechanism in Silverlight and WPF allows you to localize any string resource exposed by the standard __RadChart__ control. Once translated, you might use your resources in both Silverlight and WPF projects without changing anything.

>tipTo learn more about the ways in which to localize the RadControls please read the common topic about[Localization](http://www.telerik.com/help/silverlight/common-localization.html)__.__

## Resource Keys

__RadChart__ is a complex user interface control and its strings for localization are numerous. In order to be able to distinguish these resources, an unique identifier, called __resource key__, is assigned to each localizable string.

>Note that the resource keys exposed by the __RadChart__ control are used with values, that can be specified via the control and its properties. For example, the __ChartChartTitle__ value is applied to the title of the __RadChart__, which can be set through the __DefaultView__ of the __RadChart__. 

These resources are created for your facilitation and you can use them when you have a single __RadChart__ in your application.

When you have two controls of this type they will get localized using the one and the same resource file, as the __LocalizationManager__ localizes all of the __RadControls__ in an application. In this case you are unable to specify a specific resource file for each of the charts, so you have to do the localization manually, without the __LocalizationManager__.

Here is a list of all of the __Resources__ available and their default values:

>For the empty fields there are no default values.
