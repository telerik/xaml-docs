# Visual Structure

This section defines terms and concepts used in the scope of __RadBook__ you have to get familiar with prior to continue reading this help.

Below you can see a snapshot and explanation of the main visual elements of the __RadBook__ control.

{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}
![RadBook Visual structure](images/book_visuals_wpf.png)
{% endif %}
{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}
![RadBook Visual structure](images/book_visuals_sl.png)
{% endif %}

The structure of a __RadBook__ consists of the following main elements:

* __Left Page__: This is the page that is rendered on the left side of the book.	

* __Right Page__: This is the page that is rendered on the right side of the book.

* __Page Fold__: This is the part from the page that is dragged when the page is flipping.
