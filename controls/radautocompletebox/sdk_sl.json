Please, follow the next steps:\r\n\r\n1. Sign the .XAP file of the Silverlight application with code signing certificate. Right click on the Silverlight application and go to Properties. Choose �Signing' from the left hand side and check the checkbox 'Sign the .XAP file'.\r\n2. Click on the button 'Create Test Certificate'. Enter the password and confirm password and click the 'OK' button.\r\n3. Click on the 'More Details' button highlighted - this will show you a 'Certificate' window and click the 'Install Certificate' button.\r\n4.
