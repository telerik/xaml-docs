# Settings



__DocxFormatProvider__ allows for import of docx documents and respectively export of RadFlowDocument to docx. Additionally, the import/export settings provide modification options. The current article outlines the available settings.
      

## Export Settings

The export settings which you can specify are as follows:

### InvalidDocumentAction

This setting allows you to define the action which should be executed in case the __RadFlowDocument__ that is about to be exported is not compliant with Open Office XML standard. The possible values for the enumeration are:
              

* __None__: The RadFlowDocument will be exported as is without making any validations. This can result in invalid document that may not be opened correctly.
                  

* __ThrowAnException__: DocxFormatProvider runs validation over the document passed for export. If the document is invalid, the provider throws an __InvalidDocumentException__ which contains the list with the validation errors. This is particularly useful when you want to assure you are building valid docx documents.
                  

* __Repair__: DocxFormatProvider runs validation over the document passed for export. If there is a validation exception, the provider tries to repair it. The result is a valid docx document, but the method changes the structure of the input document.
                  
### AutoUpdateFields

The __AutoUpdateFields__ setting indicates if fields should be auto-updated when the exported document is opened. The default value is __False__.
              

The following code snippet shows how you can create and specify particular export settings to DocxFormatProvider.
        

#### __C#__

{{region radwordsprocessing-formats-and-conversion-docx-settings_0}}
    DocxFormatProvider provider = new DocxFormatProvider();
    DocxExportSettings exportSettings = new DocxExportSettings();
    exportSettings.AutoUpdateFields = true;
    exportSettings.InvalidDocumentAction = InvalidDocumentAction.ThrowException;
    provider.ExportSettings = exportSettings;
