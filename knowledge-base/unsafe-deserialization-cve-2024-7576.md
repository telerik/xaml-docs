All customers who have a Telerik UI for WPF license can access the downloads here [Product Downloads | Your Account](https://www.telerik.com/account/downloads/product-download?product=RCWPF).

## Notes

- If a project is not using the RichTextBox, the application is not affected by this vulnerability. However, we recommend customers also review [CVE-2024-8316](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/wpf/knowledge-base/insecure-deserialization-cve-2024-8316), a similar issue.
- To check your version of Telerik UI for WPF
  - Via source code: Inspect the Version property of any of the `Telerik.Windows.*` assembly references in the project.
  - Via deployed application: Locate any `Telerik.Windows.*.dll` file in the application's directory, right-click, select Properties and view the Version in the Details tab.
- If you have any questions or concerns related to this issue, open a new Technical Support case in [Your Account | Support Center](https://www.telerik.com/account/support-center/contact-us/). Technical Support is available to Telerik customers with an active support plan.
