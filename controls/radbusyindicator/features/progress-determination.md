# Progress Determination

__RadBusyIndicator__ control supports two main modes of execution. It can be either determined or indetermined. These correspond to the following scenarios: 

* a specific period of time

* an indetermined amount of time 

The default scenario is the second one - the __RadBusyIndicator__ is indetermined. You can control this via the __IsIndeterminated__ boolean property. Its default value is __True__. 

If you need a determined __RadBusyIndicator__ you have to set the value of the __IsIndeterminated__ property to __False__. In this case you can modify the __ProgressValue__ property, which will indicate how much of the predefined time have already elapsed. You can set its value through XAML or code-behind. However, to get the most out of it, you have to bind it to a percentage value (between 0 and 100) indicating the state of the ongoing process.

>tipRead more about reporting the current stage of loading via the __ProgressValue__ property [here]({%slug radbusyindicator-features-report-progress-value%}). 

Here is an example of creating a determined __RadBusyIndicator__ control:

#### __[XAML] Setting IsIndeterminate__

{{region xaml-radbusyindicator-features-progress-determination_0}}
	<telerik:RadBusyIndicator IsIndeterminate="False" />
{{endregion}}

Notice that when a determined __RadbusyIndicator__ is enabled its inner donut will be consecutively filled.

How much of the inner donut is filled depends on the __ProgressValue__ property. If it is less or equal to 0 the donut will be empty and when it is grater or equal to 100 the donut will be filled.
