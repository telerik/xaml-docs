# Backward Compatibility



This article will list the breaking changes and how they can be fixed when upgrading to a specific version of the controls to the next one.


## What's Different in 2015 Q2

### Changed

The method __FieldsUpdateManager.RegisterFieldUpdatePriority__ is deprecated. 

### What to do now

You can use the __FieldsUpdateManager.RegisterFieldUpdateInfo__ method instead, passing __FieldTypeUpdateInfo__ object with its Priority property set.

## What's Different in 2015 Q1 - 2015.1.0225

### Changed

Selecting all cells in a row will now add the whole row as selected element in one selection range instead of adding separate selection range for each cell.

### Changed

The Insert Table command called by the __RadRichTextBoxRibbonUI__ will now add table to the document without the paragraph before it.

### What to do now

To keep the old behavior pass the __InsertTableCommandParameter__ to __InsertTableCommand__ with __InsertParagraphBeforeTable__ set to true.


### Changed

The __ShowDialog__ method from __IInsertTableDialog__ interface no longer accept one parameter of type Action&lt;int, int&gt;. It is changed and now accepts one context class __InsertTableDialogContext__, which will hold the insert table callback action and any additional information.

### What to do now

Implement the interface using the context class. You can refer to the [CustomInsertTableDialog SDK demo](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/RichTextBox/CustomInsertTableDialog).


### Changed

If a [Span]({%slug radrichtextbox-features-document-elements-span%}) with Text line break symbol “¬” or page break symbol “◊” is inserted, a break will not be inserted.

### What to do now

To insert a Break, you could use the InsertLineBreak() or InsertPageBreak() as before, or to create a [Break]({%slug radrichtextbox-features-document-elements-break%}) element and insert it in a [Paragraph]({%slug radrichtextbox-features-document-elements-paragraph%}).

## What's Different in 2014 Q1 - 2014.1.0226

There are no breaking changes in this version of the control.

## What's Different in 2013 Q3 - 2013.3.1016

### Changed

As of Q3 2013 the assembly references required for RadRichTextBox to work have changed. Two additional assemblies are now needed - __Telerik.Windows.Documents.Flow.dll__ and __Telerik.Windows.Documents.Core.dll__.
            

More about all required assembly references you can find [here]({%slug radrichtextbox-frequently-asked-questions%}).
            

### What to do now

Add references to __Telerik.Windows.Documents.Flow.dll__ and __Telerik.Windows.Documents.Core.dll__.
            

### Changed

Some of RadDocument's public methods were obsoleted and they will be removed in one of the future releases. Among those are the __Insert~()__ and __Delete~()__ methods and all other methods that intervene with the document directly.
            

### What to do now

Manipulating the document directly causes different issues, including clearing of the History stack. Instead of using the obsoleted methods the recommended way to edit a document is through RadRichTextBox. In scenarios when you do not want to show a RadRichTextBox and want to manipulate the document from code you can use [RadDocumentEditor]({%slug radrichtextbox-features-raddocumenteditor%}).
            

### Changed

Change in the IFontPropertiesDialog interface so that the dialog could be populated with the values of the CurrentSpanStyle. Custom implementations of the dialog will not work.
            

### What to do now

Use the properties of FontPropertiesDialogContext:
            

-ApplyStyle as the callback.
            

-CurrentEditingStyle as the style to populate the dialog on showing it.
            

### Changed

* Telerik.Windows.Documents.Layout.SubStringPosition class has been removed.

* Telerik.Windows.Documents.Model.AnchorStyles class has been removed.

* Telerik.Windows.Documents.Layout.RadTextMeasurerSL has been removed.

### What to do now

The above are no longer needed and you should not use them.

### Changed

The float Telerik.Windows.Documents.Layout.RadTextMeasurer.GetBaseLineOffset(string fontFamlily) method has been removed.

### What to do now

The method is for internal use only.

## What's Different in 2013 Q2 - 2013.2.611

There are no breaking changes in this version of the control.

## What's Different in 2013 Q1 - 2013.2.0220

There are breaking changes related to the discontinued support of the RadRibbonBar control. The predefined UI of RadRichTextBox can now only be based on RadRibbonView.

## What's Different in 2012 Q3 - 2012.3.1017

There are no breaking changes in this version of the control.

## What's Different in 2012 Q2 - 2012.2.0607

* When creating a __Table__ programatically it no longer has a predefined set of borders. The default style of a __Table__ is __TableNormal__. It does not inherit other styles, does not contain predefined borders and is the one applied when creating a table programmatically. When creating a table from the UI, the __TableGrid__ style is applied. It has a predefined set of borders and can be applied programmatically as follows:
            

#### __C#__

{{region radrichtextbox-radrichtextbox-backward-compatibility_0}}
    table.StyleName = RadDocumentDefaultStyles.DefaultTableGridStyleName;
{{endregion}}

More about __Styles__ can be found in [this topic]({%slug radrichtextbox-features-styles%}).
