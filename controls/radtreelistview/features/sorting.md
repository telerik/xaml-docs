# {{ site.framework_name }} RadTreeListView Sorting



## 

The __RadTreeListView__ provides you with a built-in sorting functionality, which allows the user to easily sort the data by one or by several columns. The data can be sorted in three ways:

* __Ascending__

* __Descending__

* __No Sort__

The data gets sorted when the header of a column is clicked. When sorted, you should see the header of the column highlighted and the appropriate arrow for ascending or descending sorting. By clicking on the header again, the sort direction is changed to descending and on the next click the sorting is cleared. The header goes into its normal state and the arrow disappears.

As the __RadTreeListView__ directly inherits the __RadGridView__ it uses its sorting mechanism. The __RadGridView__ allows you to implement programmatic sorting, custom sorting and even multiple-column sorting. To learn more read the [respective topics]({%slug gridview-sorting-basics%}) in the __RadGridView's__ documentation.
