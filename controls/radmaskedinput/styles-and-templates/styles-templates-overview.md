# Overview

This section is intended to give you a broad understanding of the possible ways in which you can change the visual appearance of the __RadMaskedInput__ controls. There is also comprehensive information about their __ControlTemplates__. You will need this information if you want to customize its appearance. 

You can modify the look of a __RadMaskedInput__ control by either changing some of the resources exposed by the API, or by modifying its __ControlTemplate__. In the control template you are allowed to reorder the template parts and add your own elements. However, when changing the control template you should be careful to include all required parts.
