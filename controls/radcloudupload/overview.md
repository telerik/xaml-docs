## Key Features

* __Multiple Files Upload__: To save the user’s time and efforts, __RadCloudUpload__ allows upload of several files at the same time by setting a single property through its multiple files upload feature. 

* __Styling and Appearance__: The visual appearance of the control can be fully customized. There are also several pre-defined themes that can be used to stylize the upload control.

* __Automatic Upload__: Automatically upload the files right after the latter have been selected in the “Open” dialog.
