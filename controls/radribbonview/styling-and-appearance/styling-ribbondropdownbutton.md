# {{ site.framework_name }} RadRibbonView Styling the RadRibbonDropDownButton

The __RadRibbonDropDownButton__ can be styled by creating an appropriate __Style__ and setting it to the __Style__ property of the control.			

You have two options:

* To create an empty style and set it up on your own.
* To copy the default style of the control and modify it.

This topic will show you how to perform the second one.

## Modifying the Default Style

In order to copy the default style, load your project in Expression Blend and open the User Control that holds the __RadRibbonView__. In the 'Objects and Timeline' pane select the __RadRibbonDropDownButton__ you want to style.
				

{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}
![{{ site.framework_name }} RadRibbonView  ](images/RibbonView_Styling_DDButton_Locate.png)
{% endif %}
{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}
![{{ site.framework_name }} RadRibbonView  ](images/RibbonView_Styling_DDButton_LocateWPF.png)
{% endif %}

From the menu choose *Object -> Edit Style -> Edit a Copy*. You will be prompted for the name of the style and where to be placed.

>tip If you choose to define the style in Application, it would be available for the entire application. This allows you to define a style only once and then reuse it where needed.

After clicking 'OK', Expression Blend will generate the default style of the __RadRibbonDropDownButton__ control in the __Resources__ section of your User Control. The properties available for the style will be loaded in the 'Properties' pane and you will be able to modify their default values.

{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}

If you want to change the ControlTemplate elements of the __RadRibbonDropDownButton__ select the style in the 'Objects and Timeline' pane, right-click on it and choose Edit Template -> Edit Current. In the same pane the element parts for the __RadRibbonDropDownButton__'s template will get loaded.

{% endif %}

{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}

You can modify these properties to achieve the desired appearance. However the most of the visual parts of the __RadRibbonDropDownButton__ have to be styled in the template of it. To modify it select the style in the 'Objects and Timeline' pane, right-click on it and choose *Edit Template -> Edit Current*. In the same pane the element parts for the __RadRibbonDropDownButton's__ template will get loaded.

{% endif %}

{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}

Change the elements' properties until you get the desired look.

>You can also modify the default __VisualStates__ defined for the __RadRibbonDropDownButton__. They are located in the 'States' pane.

>tip By default the __Background__ and the __BroderBrush__ properties of the __RadRibbonDropDownButton__ are transparent. To modify them, edit the __RadRibbonDropDownButtonStyle__ resource and change these properties in the 'Properties' pane. The __Foreground__ property of the button can also be set from there.  

{% endif %}

{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}

If you go to the 'Resources' pane, you will see an editable list of resources generated together with the style and used by it. In this list you will find the brushes, styles and templates needed to change the visual appearance of the __RadRibbonDropDownButton__. Their names indicate to which part of the __RadRibbonDropDownButton's__ appearance they are assigned.
