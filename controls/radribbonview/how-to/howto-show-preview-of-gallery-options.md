# Show Preview of the Gallery Options



## 

In order to use the Live Preview feature of the __Ribbon Gallery__, a developer should use the __ActivatePreview__ and __DeactivatePreview__ events. When a __Gallery Item__ is hovered, the __ActivatePreview__ event is raised. When the mouse leaves the item, __DeactivatePreview__ event is raised. A developer can handle these events on both __RadGalleryItem__ control and on __RadGallery__ control.
