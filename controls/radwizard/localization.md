# {{ site.framework_name }} RadWizard Localization
The built-in localization mechanism allows you to localize __RadWizard__ control.

Here is a list of the supported languages:

* English
* German
* Spanish
* French
* Italian
* Dutch
* Turkish

You can find more information on how to achieve this in the [Localization Using Built-in Resources]({%slug common-localization%}#localization-using-built-in-resources) article.

## Resouce Keys ##

In order to be able to distinguish the localization resources, a unique identifier, called __resource key__, is assigned to each localizable string.

Here is a list of the __Resources__ available and their default values:

Key	|	Value
---	|	---	
Wizard_Cancel | Cancel
Wizard_Finish | Finish
Wizard_Help | Help
Wizard_Next | Next
Wizard_Previous | Back
