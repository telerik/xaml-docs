# {{ site.framework_name }} RadGridView Binding to Dynamic Data

__RadGridView__ provides support of several types of dynamic data. This article will discuss each one of them.

* [DynamicObject](#dynamicobject)
* [ICustomTypeProvider](#icustomtypeprovider)
* [ICustomTypeDescriptor](#icustomtypedescriptor)

## DynamicObject

>When the bound object is recognized as __IDynamicMetaObjectProvider type__, the control uses separate logic that operates with dynamic types. Thus, standard CLR properties registered in the dynamic type need to be exposed through the DLR API. A detailed look over the approach of achieving this is discussed in the [Have mixed CLR and DLR properties]({%slug gridview-how-to-use-mixed-clr-dlr-properties%}) topic.

The control supports binding to any type that implements the standard DLR interface  __IDynamicMetaObjectProvider__, such as __DynamicObject__ and __ExpandoObject__. An example of such implementation with the control is demonstrated in the [Binding to DynamicObject](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/GridView/BindingToDynamicObject) demo of the [SDK Examples Browser](https://demos.telerik.com/xaml-sdkbrowser/).

## ICustomTypeProvider

In case a custom Type needs to be provided by the dynamic type implementation, the __ICustomTypeProvider__ interface can be used. __RadGridView__ provides support for such types as well. A common implementation of the interface will consist of creating the custom Type and a custom PropertyInfo that stores the properties of this Type. An example of defining an __ICustomTypeProvider__ object bound to __RadGridView__ is illustrated in the [Binding to ICustomTypeProvider](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/GridView/BindingToICustomTypeProvider) demo of the [SDK Examples Browser](https://demos.telerik.com/xaml-sdkbrowser/).

## ICustomTypeDescriptor

When there is a need for providing the information regarding a given type at runtime, the __ICustomTypeDescriptor__ comes in handy. A demonstration of such an implementation with the RadGridView control can be found in the [Binding to ICustomTypeDescriptor](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/GridView/BindingToICustomTypeDescriptor) demo of the [SDK Examples Browser](https://demos.telerik.com/xaml-sdkbrowser/).
