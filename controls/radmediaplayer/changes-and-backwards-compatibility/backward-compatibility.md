## Telerik RadMediaPlayer - Q3 2011 

With the Q3 2011 release the __ControlTemplate__ of the __RadMediaPlayer__ is changed.  The __FullScreenPopup__ element type is changed to a __System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Popup__. If you have created a custom style for the __RadMediaPlayer__, please change the type of the  __FullScreenPopup__ element accordingly.
