# {{ site.framework_name }} RadVirtualGrid Resetting the Capacity

Inserting and removing rows or columns does not affect the __InitialRowCount__ or __InitialColumnCount__ properties. Thus, __RadVirtualGrid__ supports resetting its capacity to the values that are initially set for them. This can be achieved through the __Reset__ method and its two overloads:

* __Reset()__: Resets the capacity of the control to the values of the __InitialRowCount__ and __InitialColumnCount__ properties.

* __Reset(int rowCount, int columnCount)__: Through this overload of the Reset method, the capacity of __RadVirtualGrid__ can be reset to values different from the ones initially set to the __InitialRowCount__ and __InitialColumnCount__ properties. Furthermore, the two properties will be updated accordingly.
