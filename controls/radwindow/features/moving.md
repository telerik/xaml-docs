# {{ site.framework_name }} RadWindow Moving

The user can move the window by clicking on the __RadWindow__'s header and then drag it around the screen.

>tipWhen the __RadWindow__ gets moved, the __LayoutChangeStarted__ and the __LayoutChangeEnded__ events are raised. More about the events can be found [here]({%slug radwindow-events-overview%}).

To disable the moving of the __RadWindow__ via the UI you have to set the __CanMove__ property to __False__.

#### __C#__

{{region cs-radwindow-features-moving_0}}
	RadWindow radWindow = new RadWindow();
	radWindow.CanMove = false;
{{endregion}}

#### __VB.NET__

{{region vb-radwindow-features-moving_1}}
	Dim radWindow As New RadWindow()
	radWindow.CanMove = False
