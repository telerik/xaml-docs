Thank you for choosing Telerik __RadBulletGraph__!

The __RadBulletGraph__ control is a variation of linear gauge. It combines a number of indicators, as well as the data indicator into one control, which is light weight, easily customizable and straightforward to setup and use. The control a great  tool for dashboards as it is the optimal way to present a lot of information in relatively small size.

__Key features:__

* Easy to use – Using Telerik __RadBulletGraph__ is as easy as just dragging & dropping it from the toolbox.

* The Telerik __RadBulletGraph__ control supports the full design specification (as of March 12, 2010) : non zero-based scale, negative featured measures, projected values, having many comparative measures and quantitative ranges is not a problem.

* Data Binding Support - the control can be easily data bound to your business data, either by setting its properties directly, or by using a binding declaration.

* Styling and appearance - Telerik __RadBulletGraph__ is a 100% lookless control providing full support for Expression Blend. 

* MVVM support - Telerik __RadBulletGraph__ can be integrated with the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern to get better control over chart customization. The control exposes fully separates functionality from appearance, thus providing you the power to completely restyle it without changing a single line of code.

__Types of Bullet graphs__

There are two main types of bullet graphs - __horizontal__ and __vertical__, depending on the direction in which the control is drawn.

Below is a basic declaration of a __horizontal__ graph:

#### __[XAML] Example 1: Defining a horizontal bulletgraph control__  
{{region xaml-radbulletgraph-overview-0}}
	<telerik:RadHorizontalBulletGraph FeaturedMeasure="330" ComparativeMeasure="550" />
{{endregion}}

We can declare a __vertical__ bullet graph as shown in the code below:

#### __[XAML] Example 2: Defining a horizontal bulletgraph control__  
{{region xaml-radbulletgraph-overview-1}}
	<telerik:RadVerticalBulletGraph FeaturedMeasure="270" ComparativeMeasure="250" />
