The tooltip is triggered by setting the ToolTipTemplate property of ChartToolTipBehavior to a valid DataTemplate object during design-time and positioning the mouse cursor down somewhere on the chart during run-time. If the user hovers directly over a data point, the tooltip will display information for this particular data point.","KeyWords":"Tooltip,  barseries, charttooltipbehavior, ivelueconverter, tooltiptempalte, customizetooltip"},

For example when the trackball line crosses a line series line segment, a small circle is drawn highlighting the value of the series at this point.","KeyWords":"Track Ball,  scatterlineseries, charttrackballbehavior, trackballtemplate, trackballinfostyle, customizetrackball"},
