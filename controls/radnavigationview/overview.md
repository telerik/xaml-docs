# Overview

![RadNavigationView](images/NavigationView_Overview_Small.png)

__RadNavigationView__ is an adaptive component, used to build a consistent navigational experience in {{ site.framework_name }} applications. The control can automatically adjust its display mode based on the amount of screen space available to it, thus improving the overall user experience (UX) of your applications.				

RadNavigationView is part of the powerful UI for WPF navigation controls framework, which includes components as [RadToolBar]({%slug radtoolbar-overview%}), [RadTreeView]({%slug radtreeview-overview2%}), [RadPanelBar]({%slug radpanelbar-overview%}), [RadWindow]({%slug radwindow-overview%}), [RadMenu]({%slug radmenu-overview%}) and more.

As every control from UI for WPF, RadNavigationView comes with a set of pre-defined themes. Of course, if you choose to do so, you can design your own templates for a completely custom look using Blend for Visual Studio.

## Key Features

* __Adaptive Display Mode__:  The control dynamically adjusts its layout depending on the size that is available to it.

* __Powerful Data Binding__: You can bind the control and its components to different sources such as Objects and Collections. Read more about this in the [Data Binding]({%slug radnavigationview-populating-with-data-databinding%}) section of the documentation.

* __Sub Items Support__: This feature allows you to create a navigation menu with multiple levels of items in a tree-like structure. Read more about this in the [Hierarchy]({%slug radnavigationview-features-hierarchy%}) article.

* __Flexible Header and Footer Content__: Customize your headers and footers any way you want using direct content or data templates. Read more about this in the [Header and Footer]({%slug radnavigationview-header-and-footer%}) section of the documentation.

* __Keyboard Support__: RadNavigationView allows you to perform navigation, selection and other tasks without using the mouse. Read more about this in the [Keyboard Support]({%slug radnavigationview-features-keyboard-support%}) article.

* __UI Automation Support__: Check the [UI Automation Support]({%slug common-ui-automation%}) common article.
