# {{ site.framework_name }} RadScheduleView ReadOnlyBehavior

RadScheduleView's **ReadOnlyBehavior** is responsible for determining which operations are applicable to the appointments in the control. It can be customized in order to implement logic for whether you can save, edit, drag, resize, delete an appointment and edit a slot. This is done by inheriting the ReadOnlyBehavior class and overriding one or several of its virtual methods:

  * **CanSaveAppointment**: Override to add logic for whether an appointment can be saved.
  * **CanEditAppointment**: Override to add logic for whether an appointment can be edited.
  * **CanDragAppointment**: Override to add logic for whether an appointment can be dragged.
  * **CanResizeAppointment**: Override to add logic for whether an appointment can be resized.
  * **CanDeleteAppointment**: Override to add logic for whether an appointment can be deleted.
  * **CanEditSlot**: Override to add logic for whether a slot can be edited.

## Implementing Custom ReadOnlyBehavior

To implement a custom readonlybehavior, you have to create a class which inherits ReadOnlyBehavior.

#### __[C#] Example 1: Custom ReadOnlyBehavior__

{{region cs-radscheduleview-features-readonly-behavior_0}}
    public class CustomReadonlyBehavior : ReadOnlyBehavior
    {
        public override bool CanSaveAppointment(IReadOnlySettings readOnlySettings, IOccurrence occurrence)
        {
            return base.CanSaveAppointment(readOnlySettings, occurrence);
        }

        public override bool CanEditAppointment(IReadOnlySettings readOnlySettings, IOccurrence occurrence)
        {
            return base.CanEditAppointment(readOnlySettings, occurrence);
        }

        public override bool CanDragAppointment(IReadOnlySettings readOnlySettings, IOccurrence occurrence)
        {
            return base.CanDragAppointment(readOnlySettings, occurrence);
        }

        public override bool CanResizeAppointment(IReadOnlySettings readOnlySettings, IOccurrence occurrence)
        {
            return base.CanResizeAppointment(readOnlySettings, occurrence);
        }

        public override bool CanDeleteAppointment(IReadOnlySettings readOnlySettings, IOccurrence occurrence)
        {
            return base.CanDeleteAppointment(readOnlySettings, occurrence);
        }

        public override bool CanEditSlot(IReadOnlySettings readOnlySettings, Slot slot)
        {
            return base.CanEditSlot(readOnlySettings, slot);
        }
    }
{{endregion}}

#### __[VB.NET] Example 1: Custom ReadOnlyBehavior__

{{region vb-radscheduleview-features-readonly-behavior_1}}
    Public Class CustomReadonlyBehavior
	Inherits ReadOnlyBehavior
        Public Overrides Function CanSaveAppointment(readOnlySettings As IReadOnlySettings, occurrence As IOccurrence) As Boolean
            Return MyBase.CanSaveAppointment(readOnlySettings, occurrence)
        End Function

        Public Overrides Function CanEditAppointment(readOnlySettings As IReadOnlySettings, occurrence As IOccurrence) As Boolean
            Return MyBase.CanEditAppointment(readOnlySettings, occurrence)
        End Function

        Public Overrides Function CanDragAppointment(readOnlySettings As IReadOnlySettings, occurrence As IOccurrence) As Boolean
            Return MyBase.CanDragAppointment(readOnlySettings, occurrence)
        End Function

        Public Overrides Function CanResizeAppointment(readOnlySettings As IReadOnlySettings, occurrence As IOccurrence) As Boolean
            Return MyBase.CanResizeAppointment(readOnlySettings, occurrence)
        End Function

        Public Overrides Function CanDeleteAppointment(readOnlySettings As IReadOnlySettings, occurrence As IOccurrence) As Boolean
            Return MyBase.CanDeleteAppointment(readOnlySettings, occurrence)
        End Function

        Public Overrides Function CanEditSlot(readOnlySettings As IReadOnlySettings, slot As Slot) As Boolean
            Return MyBase.CanEditSlot(readOnlySettings, slot)
        End Function
End Class
{{endregion}}

> Note, that by default the base class implementation of the ReadOnlyBehavior class works with the [ReadOnlySlots]({%slug radscheduleview-features-speacialslots%}) of the RadScheduleView. If you want to change the default behavior, you can introduce custom logic. For an example implementation, check out the [ReadOnlyBehavior](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ScheduleView/CustomReadOnlyBehavior) SDK example.

Then you need to set it to RadScheduleView's **ReadOnlyBehavior** property.

#### __[XAML] Example 2: Setting ReadOnlyBehavior__

{{region xaml-radscheduleview-features-readonly-behavior_2}}
    <telerik:RadScheduleView>
        <telerik:RadScheduleView.ReadOnlyBehavior>
            <local:CustomReadonlyBehavior />
        </telerik:RadScheduleView.ReadOnlyBehavior>
    </telerik:RadScheduleView>
{{endregion}}

> In this example the namespace **"local"** is referring to the namespace in which the CustomReadonlyBehavior is declared.
