# Managing Data

Except displaying sets of data, Telerik's __RadGridView__ also allows you to manage them. You are able to execute the standard operations - __Insert__, __Update__ and __Delete__. You can also validate the data. Besides using this functionality, you are able to control it via the several events raised at the most important key-points of the action.

More about managing data in __RadGridView__ can be found [here]({%slug gridview-managing-data-overview%}) or you may check out the following topics:
