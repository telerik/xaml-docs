# {{ site.framework_name }} RadDocking Visual Structure

This section defines the terms and the concepts used in the scope of __RadDocking__ which you have to get familiar with prior to continue reading this help.

## Main Areas

__RadDocking__ has three main areas:
  
* __Document host__

* __Dockable area__

* __Auto hide area__

## Layout Elements

To create a fully featured layout you need the following controls: 

* __RadDocking__ – the main container, that holds all the layout, drag and re-arrange logic. It is host for all the other controls.

* __RadSplitContainer__ – this control can be hosted directly in the __RadDocking__ control, in a window in the [DocumentHost]({%slug raddocking-features-document-host%}) area or in a [ToolWindow]({%slug raddocking-features-tool-window%}). It is designed to hold a series of pane groups or other split containers and arrange them one after another supporting proportional space, dividing between its items by showing splitters between them.

* __RadPaneGroup__ – this control has a list of __Panes__ and a header with commands for the currently selected pane and displaying its header. [Read more]({%slug raddocking-features-pane-groups%})

* __RadPane__ – the content unit of the __RadDocking__ control. It has a variety of properties that allow you to customize its behavior. [Read more]({%slug raddocking-panes-radpane%})![Rad Docking Visual Structure 2](images/RadDocking_VisualStructure_2.png)

* __Auto-Hide Area__ - this is the area where the tabs of the [unpinned]({%slug raddocking-panes-pinned-unpinned-panes%}#unpinned-panes) documents are placed. An unpinned pane is shown when your mouse hovers over its tab.

* __Root Compass -__  this is the menu that marks the possible docking positions in the root docking container. It has four indicators: Left, Top, Right and Bottom, where each one of them points to the respective docking position within the root container.[Read more]({%slug raddocking-features-compass%}#root-compass)

* __Compass Menu__ - this is the menu that marks the possible docking positions within a container. The Compass menu is always shown in the middle of the container you are dragging your panes over. It has five indicators: Left, Top, Right, Bottom and Center, where each one of them points to the respective docking position within this container.

* __Dropping Area__ - area that highlights where the document will be docked if it's dropped.

* __Floating ToolWindow__ - window that is part of __RadDocking__, but is not docked. [Read more]({%slug raddocking-features-tool-window%})

* __Grouped/Tabbed Panes__ - panes grouped in a [RadPaneGroup]({%slug raddocking-features-pane-groups%}) control.

* __Docked Panes__ - the [docked panes]({%slug raddocking-features-panes-docked-floating-panes%}#docking-panes) are all those panes that are hosted inside the __RadDocking__ control and are not floatable.
