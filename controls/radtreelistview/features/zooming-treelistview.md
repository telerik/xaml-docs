# {{ site.framework_name }} RadTreeListView Zooming

The `RadTreeListView` control provides support for zooming its content through the `EnableMouseWheelScaling` and `ScaleFactor` properties. As RadTreeListView element derives from the `GridViewDataControl` class, it shares most of the `RadGridView` control's functionalities. You can see the RadGridView's [Zooming]({%slug radgridview-zooming%}) article, which provides additional information on the zooming feature.
