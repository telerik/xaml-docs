# Telerik UI for WPF First Steps with Visual Studio Extensions

This article explains how to get the Telerik UI for WPF controls in your project and start using them quickly.

Once you have your first simple control up and running, take a look at the [next steps](#next-steps) section to start exploring the control functionality in more details.

For additional resources you can also review the Related Articles section on the right.

## Download the Controls

The easiest way to get the controls to your development machine is to use the [Progress Control Panel](https://www.telerik.com/download-trial-file/v2/control-panel) or to download the automated MSI installer from [your telerik.com account](https://www.telerik.com/account/product-download?product=RCWPF).

## Creating Application with Telerik Visual Studio Extensions

The easiest way to create a Telerik UI for WPF project is to use **Visual Studio Extensions** which are distributed with the Telerik UI for WPF installer.

The Visual Studio Extensions can be accessed through the Extensions | Telerik | Telerik UI for WPF menu which has different menu items depending on the selected project in Visual Studio. The extensions can be accessed through the context menu of a WPF Application as well.

1. Open [Microsoft Visual Studio]({%slug installation-system-requirements-wpf%}).

2. Create new Telerik WPF application.

	#### __Figure 2: Go to Telerik > Telerik  UI for WPF > Create New Telerik Project__
	![Run Create Project Wizard](../integration/visual-studio-extensions/images/VSExtentions_WPF_OverviewMenuCreate.png "Run Create Project Wizard")
	
	#### __Figure 3: Creating new Telerik application__	
	![Creating new Telerik application](images/installation-adding-to-application-create-application-and-adding-control-1.png)

3. Choose the project template and the corresponding settings. For an empty project without any Telerik controls added to the view, choose the Blank option.
	
	#### __Figure 4: Choosing an application template__
	![Choosing an application template](images/installation-adding-to-application-create-application-and-adding-control-2.png)

	At this point the project references only the common Telerik.Windows.Controls.dll and you can start adding controls in the UI. 

	You can further configure the project using the Project Configuration Wizard. You can do that by going to the __Extensions > Telerik > Telerik UI for WPF > Configure Project__ menu in Visual Studio. When you open the wizard you can select the controls you are going to use from the list (or search them in the search box). Once you have selected them, click Finish. This will add the required dlls and references to your project.

	> This step is optional and you will only need it if you use controls that are not defined in Telerik.Windows.Controls.dll.

## Add a Telerik Control to the Project

For this example we will use [RadGridView]({%slug gridview-overview2%}).

### Assembly References

In order to use the __RadGridView__ control in your projects, you have to add references to the following assemblies:			

* __Telerik.Windows.Controls__
* __Telerik.Windows.Controls.GridView__
* __Telerik.Windows.Controls.Input__
* __Telerik.Windows.Data__

### Adding a Telerik Control to the Project

You can add __RadGridView__ manually by writing the XAML code in __Example 1__ or you can also add the control by dragging it from the Visual Studio Toolbox and dropping it over the XAML view.
	
#### __[XAML] Example 1: Adding RadGridView in XAML__

{{region xaml-gridview-getting-started2_0}}
	<telerik:RadGridView />
{{endregion}}

If you run the application, you will see an empty grid with no columns and rows as demonstrated in __Figure 6__. 

#### __Figure 6: The empty grid generated by the code in Example 1__

![Telerik {{ site.framework_name }} DataGrid GettingStarted 2](images/RadGridView_GettingStarted_2.png)

### Populating with Data

In order to populate the __RadGridView__ control with data, you should create a collection of business objects. Create a new class named __Profile__ and add several different type properties to it, as shown in __Example 2__.

#### __[C#] Example 2: Simple business class__

{{region cs-gridview-getting-started2_0}}
	    public class Profile
    {
        public int ID { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public DateTime Date { get; set; }
        public bool IsChecked { get; set; }
    }
{{endregion}}

#### __[VB.NET] Example 2: Simple business class__

{{region vb-gridview-getting-started2_0}}
	Public Class Profile
    Public Property ID As Integer
    Public Property Name As String
    Public Property Date As DateTime
    Public Property IsChecked As Boolean
End Class
{{endregion}}

Next, create a collection of Profile objects in the MainWindow and set the RadGridView ItemSource.  

#### __[C#] Example 3: Simple business class__

{{region cs-gridview-getting-started2_0}}
		public MainWindow()
    {
		this.InitializeComponent();
        var source = new ObservableCollection<Profile>();
        DateTime date = DateTime.Now;
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        {
        source.Add(new Profile() { ID = i, Name = "Item" + i, Date = date, IsChecked = i % 2 == 0 });
        date = date.AddDays(7);
        }
        gridView.ItemsSource = source;
    }
{{endregion}}


#### __[VB.NET] Example 3: Simple business class__

{{region vb-gridview-getting-started2_0}}
	Public Sub New()
    Me.InitializeComponent()
    Dim source = New ObservableCollection(Of Profile)()
    Dim date As DateTime = DateTime.Now

    For i As Integer = 0 To 10 - 1
        source.Add(New Profile() With {
            .ID = i,
            .Name = "Item" & i,
            .Date = date,
            .IsChecked = i Mod 2 = 0
        })
        date = date.AddDays(7)
    Next

    gridView.ItemsSource = source
	End Sub
	End Class
{{endregion}}

Now that you have prepared the needed sample data, you need to bind it to each column in XAML as shown in the Example 4 below.

#### __[XAML] Example 4: Define RadGridView in XAML__

{{region xaml-gridview-getting-started2_1}}
	<Grid>
        <telerik:RadGridView x:Name="gridView"
                             AutoGenerateColumns="False">
            <telerik:RadGridView.Columns>
                <telerik:GridViewDataColumn DataMemberBinding="{Binding ID}"/>
                <telerik:GridViewDataColumn DataMemberBinding="{Binding Name}" />
                <telerik:GridViewDataColumn DataMemberBinding="{Binding Date}" />
                <telerik:GridViewDataColumn DataMemberBinding="{Binding IsChecked}" />
            </telerik:RadGridView.Columns>
        </telerik:RadGridView>
    </Grid>
{{endregion}}

Run the project and you should see something like this:

#### __Figure 7: The final result__
