# Wiring UI



RadPdfViewer provides commands and respective command descriptors that you can easily bind to when creating UI.
      

>tipYou can download a runnable project from our online SDK repository
          [here](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk), the example is listed as __PdfViewer / FirstLook__.
        

The project is wired to work with RadToolBar and RadContextMenu.
      

You can note how the DataContext of the toolbar is bound to the instance of __RadPdfViewer__ on the same page.
