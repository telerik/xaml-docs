# Data Binding



## 

__RadContextMenu__ supports data binding to various data sources and services. Moreover, __RadContextMenu__ can be used in two modes:

* __Data bound mode__ - simply set __RadContextMenu.ItemsSource__ and __RadContextMenu__ will automatically display the provided items.

* __Manual mode__ - add your items manually to the __RadContextMenu.Items__ collection.
