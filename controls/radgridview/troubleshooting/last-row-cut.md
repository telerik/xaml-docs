# {{ site.framework_name }} RadGridView Last row is not fully visible

__PROBLEM__

When you have set a TextWrapping for a column, consequently the row's height becomes bigger. As the user scrolls to the bottom, it is possible that the __last row is not fully visible__, its content has been cut.
        
__CAUSE__

RadGridView relies on average row calculations to display the visual elements as you scroll down. Since you have enabled TextWrapping on a column, the default row's height is now more than 25 PX. In that case some of the rows may not be calculated accurately.
        
__SOLUTION__

If you want to avoid this behavior you may force RadGridView to correctly calculate its rows by __setting the RowHeight property to a fixed size__. This size should be properly set based on the actual row height you have after the text has been wrapped.
