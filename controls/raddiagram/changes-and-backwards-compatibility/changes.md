## Q1 2014

### What's Fixed

* Connectors' activation doesn't work correctly with collapsed items

* When zooming, the ManipulationAdorner should not be scaled.

### What's New

* Add additional/optional boolean parameter in Layout/LayoutAsync methods to support AutoFit.

	>Instead of adding a new boolean paramether, a new method was exposed - __AutoFitAsync()__. It is further described in the [Pan And Zoom]({%slug raddiagrams-features-pan-zoom%}) tutorial. 				

* Extend the serialization/deserialization of custom RadDiagramConnectors 

* Extensibility points for MouseTools 

	>You can examine the [Tools Customization]({%slug raddiagram-tools-customization%}) tutorial for more information.
