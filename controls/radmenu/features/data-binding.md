# Data Binding

__RadMenu__ supports data binding to various data sources and services. Moreover, __RadMenu__ can be used in two modes:

* __Data bound mode__ - simply set __RadMenu.ItemsSource__ and __RadMenu__ will automatically display the provided items.

* __Manual mode__ - add your items manually to the __RadMenu.Items__ collection.
