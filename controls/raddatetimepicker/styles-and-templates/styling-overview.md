# Overview

This section is intended to give you a broad understanding of the possible ways to change the visual appearance of the __RadDateTimePicker__ control. There is also comprehensive information about its __ControlTemplates__. You will need this information if you want to customize their appearance.

>tip To learn how to change the control's theme, please read the common [Implicit Styles]({%slug styling-apperance-implicit-styles-overview%}) topic.

You can modify the look of the __RadDateTimePicker__ control either by changing some of the resources exposed by the API, or by modifying their __ControlTemplates__. In the control template you are allowed to reorder the template parts and add your own elements. However, when changing the __ControlTemplate__ you should be careful to include all required parts.

>Note that when changing the __ControlTemplate__ you should include all required parts. Even if your code compiles, some of the functionality may be subject to impact due to the omission of the required parts. The required parts are usually marked with the prefix "PART_".
