# {{ site.framework_name }} RadTileList Templates Structure #

Using [Implicit styles]({%slug styling-apperance-implicit-styles-overview%}) gives you the ability to easily extract and edit the default __ControlTemplates__ of the controls. You can follow [this]({%slug styling-apperance-editing-control-templates%}) article on how to extract the __ControlTemplates__.

Like most WPF controls, __RadTileList__ also allows you to template it in order to change the control from the inside. Except for templating the whole control, you can also template particular parts of it. This topic will make you familiar with the template structures of:

*	[RadTileList Template Structure](#radtilelist)
	
*	[TileGroupContainer Template Structure](#tilegroupcontainer)
	
*	[Tile Template Structure](#tile)
