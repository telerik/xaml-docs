# {{ site.framework_name }} RadMap Template Structure

Like most controls, the __RadMap__ also allows you to template it in order to change the control from the inside. Except for templating the whole control, you can also template parts of it. This topic will make you familiar with the template structures of the:

* [RadMap](#radMap)

* [MapCommandBar](#mapCommandBar)

* [MapNavigation](#mapNavigation)

* [MapZoomBar](#mapZoomBar)

* [MapScale](#mapScale)

* [MapMouseLocationIndicator](#mapMouseLocationIndicator)

>For more information about templating and how to modify the default templates of the __RadControls__ read [the common topics](http://www.telerik.com/help/silverlight/common-styling-appearance-edit-control-templates-blend.html) on this matter.
