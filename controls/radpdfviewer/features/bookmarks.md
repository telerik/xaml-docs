# {{ site.framework_name }} RadPdfViewer Bookmarks (Outlines)

RadPdfViewer enables you to open documents and show the bookmarks they contain in a bookmarks panel. Bookmarks or Outlines are a tree-structured hierarchy that the reader presents as a visual table of contents separated from the actual content as a side panel. The Bookmark items allow users, by interacting with them, to navigate through parts of the document and/or invoke different actions.  

>The Bookmarks (Outlines) functionality is available as of R3 2018.

## Visualizing Bookmarks

In **RadPdfViewer**, you can show bookmarks using **RadPdfViewerNavigationPane**. This is a control representing an area that can display different navigation panels, including the Bookmarks of the PDF document which serve as a table of contents. RadPdfViewerNavigationPane exposes the **PaneWidth** property, which you can use to specify the width of the panel.

#### [XAML] Example 1: Define RadPdfViewerNavigationPane

{{region radpdfviewer-features-bookmarks_0}}

	<Grid>
	    <Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
	        <ColumnDefinition Width="Auto" />
	        <ColumnDefinition />
	    </Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
	    <telerik:RadPdfViewerNavigationPane RadPdfViewer="{Binding ElementName=pdfViewer, Mode=OneTime}" PaneWidth="300" />
	    <telerik:RadPdfViewer Grid.Column="1" x:Name="pdfViewer" DataContext="{Binding ElementName=pdfViewer, Path=CommandDescriptors}" />
	</Grid>
{{endregion}}


The items inside the panel are represented by the **BookmarkItem** class, which can be used to obtain information about the style, text, appearance, action and destination of the bookmark.


## Setting the Way the Document Looks Like When Opened in a Viewer

The PDF format allows you to specify how the document should be displayed when opened. In RadPdfViewer, you can obtain the information about the document visualization using the **PageMode** property. It is of type **PageMode** and supports two values. The enum controls if any of the tabs in the havigation pane should be selected (opened) by default when the document contains bookmarks. The values of **PageMode** could be:

* **UseNone**: Nothing additional except the document is visible. 
* **UseBookmarks**: Document bookmarks are visible.

## Obtaining Bookmarks

You have access to the bookmarks in a document through the Bookmarks collection exposed by RadFixedDocument. This collection can be used to iterate the bookmarks and find a specific one.

>If you need to modify the collection of bookmarks or a particular bookmark, you can use the [API exposed by PdfProcessing](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/document-processing/libraries/radpdfprocessing/features/bookmarks).


## Commands

The commands related to bookmarks are exposed in the **CommandDescriptors** property of **RadPdfViewer**. You can invoke them to execute a functionality of the bookmarks.

### ActivateBookmarkItemCommand

This command represents the bookmark activated action (usually a user click event). When executed, **RadPdfViewer** displays the related Bookmark destination or executes the provided action. The command accepts a parameter of type [**BookmarkItem**](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/wpf/api/telerik.windows.documents.fixed.model.navigation.bookmarkitem). 

### SyncCurrentBookmarkItemCommand

Synchronizes the current location in the document with the related bookmark item. Can be invoked through the UI using the **Find Current Bookmark** button, shown in **Figure 1**.

#### [C#] Example 2: Invoking a command in code

{{region radpdfviewer-features-bookmarks_1}}

	this.pdfViewer.CommandDescriptors.SyncCurrentBookmarkItemCommandDescriptor.Command.Execute(null);
