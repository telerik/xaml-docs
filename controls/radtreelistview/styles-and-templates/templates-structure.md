# {{ site.framework_name }} RadTreeListView Templates Structure



This section is intended to give a broad understanding of the possible ways for modifying the appearance of the __RadTreeListView__ and its elements. This can be achieved either by using the resources exposed by the API or by changing the appropriate __ControlTemplates__. Once you decide on the later, you will be able to reorder some of the template parts or add your own elements. However, in this case you should be careful to include all required parts. 

Basically, this topic will make you familiar with:

* [RadTreeListView Template Structure](#radtreelistview);

* [TreeListViewRow Template Structure](#treelistviewrow);

As the __RadTreeListView__ inherits __RadGridView__, it uses the same styling mechanism and the rest of the templates are equal. You may take a look at the [Styles and Templates]({%slug radgridview-styles-and-templates-templates-structure%}) section of the __RadGridView__ for further reference.
      

>tip For more information about templating and how to modify the default template of the RadControls read [the common topics]({%slug styling-apperance-editing-control-templates%}) on this matter.
