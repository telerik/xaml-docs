# {{ site.framework_name }} RadDesktopAlert Getting Started

This topic will walk you through the creating of __RadDesktopAlert__.    

>In order to use __RadDesktopAlert__ in your project you have to add references to the following three assemblies:
> * Telerik.Windows.Controls.dll
> * Telerik.Windows.Controls.Navigation.dll
> * Telerik.Windows.Data.dll

You can include the control in your page by either dragging it from the toolbox in Visual Studio, or manually creating the control. Below is an example of how to create __RadDesktopAlert__ in code behind:

#### __[C#]  Creating RadDesktopAlert__

{{region cs-raddesktopalert-getting-started_0}}
	var alert = new RadDesktopAlert();
	alert.Header = "MAIL NOTIFICATION";
	alert.Content = "Hello, Here are two things that we noticed today on our daily meeting.";
	alert.ShowDuration = 3000;
{{endregion}}

#### __[VB]  Creating RadDesktopAlert__

{{region vb-raddesktopalert-getting-started_0}}
	Dim alert = New RadDesktopAlert()
	alert.Header = "MAIL NOTIFICATION"
	alert.Content = "Hello, Here are two things that we noticed today on our daily meeting."
	alert.ShowDuration = 3000
{{endregion}}

>__RadDesktopAlert__ is designed to work with [__RadDesktopAlertManager__]({%slug raddesktopalert-desktop-alert-manager%}). If just placed in XAML it won't be completely functional.

In order to visualize it, a new instance of __RadDesktopAlertManager__ should be created and the already declared above __RadDesktopAlert__ should be passed as a parameter to its __ShowAlert__ method:

#### __[C#]  Showing RadDesktopAlert__

{{region cs-raddesktopalert-getting-started_1}}
	RadDesktopAlertManager manager = new RadDesktopAlertManager();
	manager.ShowAlert(alert);
{{endregion}}

#### __[VB]  Showing RadDesktopAlert__

{{region vb-raddesktopalert-getting-started_1}}
	Dim manager As New RadDesktopAlertManager()
	manager.ShowAlert(alert)
{{endregion}}

## Setting a Theme

The controls from our suite support different themes. You can see how to apply a theme different than the default one in the [Setting a Theme]({%slug styling-apperance-implicit-styles-overview%}) help article.

>important Changing the theme using implicit styles will affect all controls that have styles defined in the merged resource dictionaries. This is applicable only for the controls in the scope in which the resources are merged. 

To change the theme, you can follow the steps below:

* Choose between the themes and add reference to the corresponding theme assembly (ex: **Telerik.Windows.Themes.Windows8.dll**). You can see the different themes applied in the **Theming** examples from our {% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}[WPF Controls Examples](https://demos.telerik.com/wpf/){% else %}[Silverlight Controls Examples](https://demos.telerik.com/silverlight/#/Theming){% endif %} application.

* Merge the ResourceDictionaries with the namespace required for the controls that you are using from the theme assembly. For the __RadDesktopAlert__, you will need to merge the following resources:

	* __Telerik.Windows.Controls__
	* __Telerik.Windows.Controls.Navigation__

__Example 1__ demonstrates how to merge the ResourceDictionaries so that they are applied globally for the entire application.

#### __[XAML] Example 1: Merge the ResourceDictionaries__  
{{region raddesktopalert-getting-started_6}}
	<Application.Resources>
		<ResourceDictionary>
			<ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries>
				<ResourceDictionary Source="/Telerik.Windows.Themes.Windows8;component/Themes/System.Windows.xaml"/>
				<ResourceDictionary Source="/Telerik.Windows.Themes.Windows8;component/Themes/Telerik.Windows.Controls.xaml"/>
				<ResourceDictionary Source="/Telerik.Windows.Themes.Windows8;component/Themes/Telerik.Windows.Controls.Navigation.xaml"/>
			</ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries>
		</ResourceDictionary>
	</Application.Resources>
{{endregion}}

>Alternatively, you can use the theme of the control via the {% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}[StyleManager](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/wpf/styling-and-appearance/stylemanager/common-styling-apperance-setting-theme-wpf){% else %}[StyleManager](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/silverlight/styling-and-appearance/stylemanager/common-styling-apperance-setting-theme){% endif %}.

__Figure 1__ shows a __RadDesktopAlert__ with the **Windows8** theme applied.
