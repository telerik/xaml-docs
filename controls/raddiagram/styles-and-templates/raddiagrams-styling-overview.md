# Overview

This section is intended to give you a broad understanding of the possible ways by which you can change the visual appearance of the __RadDiagram__ framework and its elements. It also provides comprehensive information about their __ControlTemplates__. You will need this information if you want to customize the appearance of your Diagramming solution.

You can modify the look of the __RadDiagram__ and its elements either by changing some of the resources exposed by the API, or by modifying their __ControlTemplates__. In the control template you are allowed to reorder the template parts and add your own elements. However, when changing the control template you should be careful to include all required parts.
