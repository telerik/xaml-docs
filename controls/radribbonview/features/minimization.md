# {{ site.framework_name }} RadRibbonView Minimization

__RadRibbonView__ supports minimization, which means that the ribbon may be hidden so that only its tab headers remain visible. In this state, more screen real estate is available to the client area of the window.

By clicking a tab header, the ribbon appears in a popup over the window client area and all of its controls are accessible.

There are a few ways for the end user to toggle the minimization state of the __RadRibbonView__:			

* Double click on any of the tab headers.				

* Choose 'Minimize the Ribbon' under the Quick Access Tool bar menu.

## Properties

The following properties are related to the minimize feature:

* __IsMinimizable__ - use this property to enable/disable the minimization functionality of the __RibbonView__. The default value is __True__.					

* __IsMinimized__ - use this property to set or get the current minimize state of the __RibbonView__.					

* __IsMinimizedPopupOpen__ - use this property to get whether the minimized popup menu of the __RibbonView__ is opened or not.
