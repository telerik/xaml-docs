## CreateAppointment / CreateAppointmentWithDialog Commands

When you want to create a new appointment and show the EditAppointmentDialog, then you need to use the `CreateAppointment` or `CreateAppointmentWithDialog` commands. If no parameter is passed, the `SelectedSlot` of `RadScheduleView` will be used for the new appointment start and end dates. If you want to explicitly specify which will be the start and end date you should pass a parameter of type `IDateSpan` (for example Slot is an IDateSpan).

The difference between both commands is when neither the parameter nor the `SelectedSlot` is set. In this case only the `CreateAppointmentWithDialog` command will show EditAppointmentDialog for the first visible slot, while `CreateAppointment` command won’t be executed.

#### __C#__

## CreateInlineAppointment Command

Use it when you want to create a new appointment via the inline editing. If no parameter is passed, the `SelectedSlot` of `RadScheduleView` will be used for the new appointment start and end dates.
