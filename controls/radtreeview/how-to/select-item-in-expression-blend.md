# {{ site.framework_name }} RadTreeView Select an Item in Expression Blend



## 

To select a control from the design surface in Expression Blend click __Direct Selection__(


         
      ) or __Selection__(


         
      ) in the Toolbox, and then select the control on the artboard. You may have to click the object several times if its parent container is not already active. Double-clicking an object on the artboard when you are using the Selection tool activates the object's parent container.

The other way to select a control is to click it in the __Interaction__panel under __Objects and Timeline__.
