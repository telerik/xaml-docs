# {{ site.framework_name }} RadGridView Defer Filtering Until the Filter Button is Clicked

By default, when in **Popup** filtering mode, filtering will be applied to the RadGridView control once any of the two field filter editors loses focus.

You can set a column's **IsFilteringDeferred** property to **True** to change this behavior so that filtering will be performed only when the end user clicks the **Filter** button. Please note that the **Clear** button will immediately clear the column filter regardless of this setting.

#### __[C#] Example 1: Set the IsFilteringDeferred on all columns__
{{region cs-gridview-filtering-howto-defer-filtering-until-the-filter-button-is-clicked_1}}
    private void GridView_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
    {
        foreach (var column in this.GridView.Columns)
        {
            column.IsFilteringDeferred = true;
        }
    }
{{endregion}}
