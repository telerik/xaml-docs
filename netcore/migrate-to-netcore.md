# Migrating to .NET Core

This article shows how to migrate from an existing WPF .NET Framework project to a .NET one (.NET Core 3.1, .NET 6, .NET 7 or .NET 8).

>tip Before proceeding with this topic you can check if your application's code is compatible with .NET Core using the [Microsoft Portability Analyzer](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/are-your-windows-forms-and-wpf-applications-ready-for-net-core-3-0/) tool.

1. Create a new __.NET Core 3.1__ application using Visual Studio.

	>tip You can also use the Telerik Visual Studio Extensions to create a new project. Read more about this in the [Integration]({%slug radcontrols-for-wpf-vs-extensions-project-creation%}) section of the documentation.
	
2. Add the existing files from the original project as linked files to the .NET Core project.

3. Reference the Telerik assemblies built against .NET Core 3.1.
	
	If Telerik UI for WPF is installed on the machine, you can find the dlls in the "*UI for WPF installation folder\Binaries\NetCore*" folder. Otherwise, [download the .zip file]({%slug installation-installing-from-zip-wpf%}) with the dlls or install them via the [NuGet package manager]({%slug nuget-installation%}).

## Tips

* If your project has images with [__Build Action__](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/build-actions?view=vs-2019) set to Resource, change it to Embeded Resource or Content.

* If you use the __AssemblyInfo__ or __App.manifest__ files from your original project, add them manually in the .NET Core project. The new project template uses a different approach and generates the same assembly attributes as part of the build process.
	
	#### __[XML] Example 1: GenerateAssemblyInfo attribute__
	{{region netcore-support-migration-0}}
		<generateassemblyinfo>false</generateassemblyinfo>
	{{endregion}}

* The getting started experience in RadRichTextBox for .NET Core has been improved compared to its .NET Framework alternative. Check the [.NET Core Support]({%slug radrichtextbox-getting-started-net-core-support%}) help topic for more details on the changes you might encounter.
