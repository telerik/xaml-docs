# Styling FilteringControl

>tipBefore reading this topic, you might find useful to get familiar with the [Template Structure of the FilteringControl]({%slug radgridview-styles-and-templates-templates-structure%}).
      
__GridViewColumn__ exposes the __FilteringControlStyle__ property of type __Style__. It is applied to the __FilteringControl__ of the column.
      

You have two options:

* To create an empty style and set it up on your own.

* To copy the default styles of the control and modify it.

This topic will show you how to perform the second one.

## Modifying the Default Style

The default style is available with the installation of the RadControls. You can find it browsing through the Themes folder for a particlular Theme "..\Themes\OfficeBlack\Themes" inside "Telerik.Windows.Controls.GridView.xaml" file.
        

>tipIf you choose to define the style in Application, it would be available for the entire application. This allows you to define a style only once and then reuse it where needed.

* __PART_DisctinctFilter__ - the stack panel that holds the SelectAll checkbox, the distinct values listbox and the close button
