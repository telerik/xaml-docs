# Developer Focused Examples

The [Telerik XAML SDK repository](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/) provides additional demos for most of the Telerik UI for {% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %} controls. The examples demonstrate many specific user case scenarios, that might be really helpful. In this article you can find the complete list of all SDK examples for __RadBulletGraph__.

## List of all RadBulletGraph SDK examples:

{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}

* __[Creating a BulletGraph programmatically](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/BulletGraph/WPF/CreatingABulletGraphProgrammatically)__ - 
The following example will demonstrate how to create a simple Horizontal Bullet graph programmatically but the approach is the same for the Vertical Bullet graph too.
{% endif %}
{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}
