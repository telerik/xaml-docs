## Other

As of **R1 2020**, the **CompletionListWindow** which is of type **CompletionListPopup** exposes a **TextInserting** event. Its arguments are of type **CompletionListTextInsertingEventArgs** and provide the following properties:

* **Cancel**: Gets or sets a value indication whether the text insertion should be cancelled.
* **SpanToReplace**: Gets or sets the span which will be replaced with the inserted text.
* **TextToInsert**: Gets or sets the text that is selected from the CompletionListPopup.

**Example 1** demonstrates how to use this event to replace the text which was entered before an item from the completion list was selected.

#### __[C#] Example 1: Handle the TextInserting event__
{{region cs-radsyntaxeditor-events-1}}

    private void CompletionListWindow_TextInserting(object sender, CompletionListTextInsertingEventArgs e)
    {
        string lineText = this.syntaxEditor.Document.CurrentSnapshot.GetLineFromPosition(this.syntaxEditor.CaretPosition.Index).GetText();
        string[] splitted = lineText.Split(new char[] { ' ' });
        string lastWord = splitted.Last();
        if (e.TextToInsert.ToLower().StartsWith(lastWord.ToLower()))
        {
            int wordLength = lastWord.Length;
            int spanEnd = e.SpanToReplace.Start;
            e.SpanToReplace = Telerik.Windows.SyntaxEditor.Core.Text.Span.FromBounds(spanEnd - wordLength, spanEnd);
        }
    }
