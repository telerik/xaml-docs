# Overview

In order to display items, you have to populate the __RadRating__ control with some data. You can do this in four ways:		

* You just add new __RadRating__ and it comes with its default 5 rating items [stars]		  

* Set a value to the __NumberOfItemsToGenerate__ property of the __RadRating__ control		  

* Manually, by adding items to the __Items__ collection		  

* With data binding, by using the __ItemsSource__ property
