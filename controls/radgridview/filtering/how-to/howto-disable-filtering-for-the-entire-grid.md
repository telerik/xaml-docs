# {{ site.framework_name }} RadGridView Disable Filtering for the Entire Grid

To disable filtering for the entire grid, set RadGridView.IsFilteringAllowed to false. This will hide the filtering UI and the end user will not be able to perform filtering. The IsFilteringAllowed property is true by default.
