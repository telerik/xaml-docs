# Keyboard Support



## 

__RadTreeListView__exposes several useful properties and events, which can help you to control the keyboard interaction and to get notified when keyboard events occur. Moreover, by using the keyboard you can perform some of the most common tasks:

* Change the __selection__ - use the __arrow__ keys to change your selection. To select multiple rows hold the __Shift\Ctrl__ key pressed and use the arrow keys or the mouse to select the desired rows. 

* __Sort__ by multiple columns - just hold the __Shift__ key pressed and click all column headers by which you wish to sort your data. 

* __Start cell edit__ - press __F2__ and the current cell will enter in edit mode. 

* __End cell edit__ - press __Enter__ while the cell is in edit mode. This will confirm the changes you've made. 

* __Cancel cell edit__ - press __Escape__ while the cell is in edit mode. This will rollback the changes you've made. 

As the __RadTreeListView__ directly inherits the __RadGridView__ it handles the keyboard in the same way. To learn more read the
