# {{ site.framework_name }} RadWindow Working with RadWindow

This topic will explain you how to work with the __RadWindow__ in details.

## Create a RadWindow

In order to use the __RadWindow__ in your application you have to add a reference to the __Telerik.Windows.Controls.Navigation__ assembly in your project.

After the reference is available, you can declare a __RadWindow__. Here is an example.

#### __C#__

{{region cs-radwindow-features-working-with-radwindow_0}}
	RadWindow radWindow = new RadWindow();
	radWindow.Width = 400;
	radWindow.Height = 300;
{{endregion}}

#### __VB.NET__

{{region vb-radwindow-features-working-with-radwindow_1}}
	Dim radWindow As New RadWindow()
	radWindow.Width = 400
	radWindow.Height = 300
{{endregion}}

## Show the RadWindow

When you want to display the __RadWindow__ you have two options - to display it as a __window__ or as a __modal dialog window__.

>tipTo learn more about modal windows read [here]({%slug radwindow-features-modal-windows%}).

Call the __Show()__ method of the __RadWindow__ instance to open it as a __normal window__.

#### __C#__

{{region cs-radwindow-features-working-with-radwindow_2}}
	radWindow.Show();
{{endregion}}

#### __VB.NET__

{{region vb-radwindow-features-working-with-radwindow_3}}
	radWindow.Show()
{{endregion}}

Call the __ShowDialog()__ method of the __RadWindow__ instance to open it as a __modal dialog window__.

#### __C#__

{{region cs-radwindow-features-working-with-radwindow_4}}
	radWindow.ShowDialog();
{{endregion}}

#### __VB.NET__

{{region vb-radwindow-features-working-with-radwindow_5}}
	radWindow.ShowDialog()
{{endregion}}

>tipLearn more about positioning the __RadWindow__ by reading the [Positioning]({%slug radwindow-features-positioning%}) topic.

## Add content to the RadWindow

To add a content to the __RadWindow__ you can use either the __Content__ or the __ContentTemplate__ properties.

If you have a window-specific content, use the __Content__ property.

>tipAs the __Content__ property is of type object you can set it to any control you like. If you want to have a more complex content that consists of more than one control, be sure to wrap them inside a layout control and pass the layout control as content.You can also set the content of the __RadWindow__ to a __UserControl__.

>The only scenario, where you can add content to the __RadWindow__ at design-time, is when the __RadWindow__ represents an entire user control. To learn more about that read [here]({%slug radwindow-how-to-use-radwindow-as-user-control%}).

#### __C#__

{{region cs-radwindow-features-working-with-radwindow_6}}
	Grid grid = new Grid();
	grid.Background = new SolidColorBrush(Color.FromArgb(255, 240, 255, 255));
	radWindow.Content = grid;
{{endregion}}

#### __VB.NET__

{{region vb-radwindow-features-working-with-radwindow_7}}
	Dim grid As New Grid()
	grid.Background = New SolidColorBrush(Color.FromArgb(255, 240, 255, 255))
	radWindow.Content = grid
{{endregion}}

If you want to share a common layout structure for the content of multiple windows, define an appropriate __DataTemplate__ and set it to the __ContentTemplate__ property of the __RadWindow__.

#### __XAML__

{{region xaml-radwindow-features-working-with-radwindow_8}}
	<UserControl.Resources>
	    <DataTemplate x:Key="WindowContentTemplate">
	        <Grid Background="Azure" />
	    </DataTemplate>
	</UserControl.Resources>
{{endregion}}

#### __C#__

{{region cs-radwindow-features-working-with-radwindow_9}}
	radWindow.ContentTemplate = this.Resources["WindowContentTemplate"] as DataTemplate;
{{endregion}}

#### __VB.NET__

{{region vb-radwindow-features-working-with-radwindow_10}}
	radWindow.ContentTemplate = TryCast(Me.Resources("WindowContentTemplate"), DataTemplate)
{{endregion}}

## Program the RadWindow

The __RadWindow__ exposes a few methods, that allow you to programmatically control its behavior. Here is a list of them:

* __BringToFront__: Attempts to bring the __RadWindow__ over any other __RadWindows__ except topmost. 

* __Close__: Closes the __RadWindow__.

## Modify the appearance of the RadWindow

To modify the default appearance of the __RadWindow__ you can use the following properties:

* __BorderBrush__: Changes the outer border of the __RadWindow__ and the outer border of its content area.

* __Background__: Changes the background of the content area.

* __CaptionHeight__: Gets or sets the height of the extent of the top of the window threatened as the caption.

* __CornerRadius__: Gets or sets a value that represents the degree to which the corners of the window are rounded.

{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}
* __ModalBackground__: Changes the color of the background behind the __RadWindow__ when it is opened as a modal dialog.
{% endif %}

Also you can create a style and apply it to the __RadWindow__ or modify the default template of the __RadWindow__ to change its overall look. To learn more read the [Styles and Templates]({%slug radwindow-styles-and-templates-styling-the-predefined-windows%}) section.
