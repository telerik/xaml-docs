You can bind the RadHeatMap to any source that implements one of the following interfaces:\r\n\r\n  - IEnumerable - supports simple iteration of a collection. See the MSDN article for more on IEnumerable.\r\n  - ICollection - extends IEnumerable and supports size, enumerator, and synchronization methods for collections.\r\n  - IList - extends ICollection and is the base class for lists.","KeyWords":"Populating with Data,  membermapping, databinding, rowheadersettings, verticaldefinition, heatmapvaluegradientcolorizer"}]
