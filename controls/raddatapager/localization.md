# Localization



The built-in localization mechanism in {% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %} allows you to localize __RadDataPager__ control.
      

Here is a list of the supported languages:
      

* English
  

* German
  

* Spanish
  

* French
  

* Italian
  

* Dutch
  

* Turkish
        

>To learn more about the ways to localize the RadControls please read the common topic about   {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}[Localization](http://www.telerik.com/help/silverlight/common-localization.html){% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}[Localization](http://www.telerik.com/help/wpf/common-localization.html){% endif %}
        .

Below you may see the resource keys and the strings they are associated with.

## Resource Keys

The resources of the control can be localized by using an unique identifier called resource key that is assigned to each localizable string. Below you may find a list of the Resources available and their default values:


<table> <tr>KeyValue</tr><tr><td>RadDataPagerEllipsisString</td><td>...</td></tr><tr><td>RadDataPagerOf</td><td>of</td></tr><tr><td>RadDataPagerPage</td><td>Page</td></tr></table>
