# {{ site.framework_name }} RadMenu Visual Structure

This section defines terms and concepts used in the scope of __RadMenu__ that you need to get familiar with prior to continue reading this help. They can also be helpful when contacting our support service in order to describe your issue better. Below you can see snapshots and explanations of the main states and visual elements of the standard __RadMenu__ control.        

The __RadMenu__ is a user interface control that presents users with navigation in the form of menu. The contents can be shown and hidden as the menu items expand and collapse. In its default state, the items are collapsed, displaying only their headers as it is shown on the snapshot below.
