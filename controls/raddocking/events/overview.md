		* __ActivePaneChangedEventArgs__ â€“ Exposes information about NewPane (activated) and OldPane (deactivated).
		
	* __PaneStateChange__ - This event is fired whenever the state of the RadPane is changed (e.g., pin, unpin, close, show, etc.).

>For example, when you [unpin]({%slug raddocking-panes-pinned-unpinned-panes%}) a RadPane, the events fire in this order:                   
>	* __PreviewUnpin__
>	* __Unpin__
>	* __PaneStateChange__

>tip __PreviewShow__ and __Show__ events are fired when you invoke the __ShowAllPanes__ method of the __RadPaneGroup__ class. This method will show all hidden panes.

>When you close a floatable window, the "close" events fired in this order:
> 	* __PreviewWindowClose__
> 	* __PreviewClose__
> 	* __WindowClose__
> 	* __Close__

* __Compass Events__

	* __PreviewShowCompass__ - Occurs when the [Compass]({%slug raddocking-features-compass%}) is shown.

* __Save\Load Layout Events__

	* __ElementLoading__ - Raised when a docking element (__Pane__, __PaneGroup__ or __SplitContainer__) is about to be loaded. The passed event argument is of type __LayoutSerializationLoadingEventArgs__.

	* __ElementLoaded__ - Raised after a docking element (__Pane__, __PaneGroup__ or __SplitContainer__) is loaded. The passed event argument is of type __LayoutSerializationEventArgs__.

	* __ElementSaving__ - Raised when a docking element (__Pane__, __PaneGroup__ or __SplitContainer__) is about to be saved. The passed event argument is of type __LayoutSerializationEventArgs__.
	
	* __ElementLayoutSaving__ (introduced with R2 2016 of UI for {% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %}) - Raised when a docking element (__Pane__, __PaneGroup__ or __SplitContainer__) starts saving. The passed event argument is of type __LayoutSerializationSavingEventArgs_.

	* __ElementSaved__ - Raised after a docking element (__Pane__, __PaneGroup__ or __SplitContainer__) is saved. The passed event argument is of type __LayoutSerializationEventArgs__.

	* __ElementCleaning__- Raised when a docking element (__Pane__, __PaneGroup__ or __SplitContainer__) is about to be cleaned. The passed event argument is of type __LayoutSerializationEventArgs__.
	
	* __ElementLayoutCleaning__ (introduced with R2 2016 of UI for {% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %}) - Raised when a docking element (__Pane__, __PaneGroup__ or __SplitContainer__) starts cleaning up. The passed event argument is of type __LayoutSerializationCleaningEventArgs__.

	* __ElementCleaned__ - Raised after a docking element (__Pane__, __PaneGroup__ or __SplitContainer__) is cleaned. The passed event argument is of type __LayoutSerializationEventArgs__.
	
	* __CustomElementLoading__ - Raised when a custom docking element (that derives from __RadPane__, __RadPaneGroup__ or __RadSplitContainer__) is about to be loaded. The passed event argument is of type __LayoutSerializationCustomLoadingEventArgs__.

>tipElements are __cleaned just before loading__ the layout - This operation is performed to prepare the Docking control for the new layout.

>tipFor more information about saving and loading __RadDocking__ layout, take a look at the [Save\Load Layout]({%slug raddocking-features-save-load-layout-overview%}) topic.

* __ElementCreated Events__ (introduced in Q1 2016 SP1 of UI for {% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %}).

	* __ToolWindowCreated__ - Raised when a ToolWindow instance is internally auto-generated by RadDocking.
	
	* __PaneGroupCreated__ - Raised when a PaneGroup instance is internally auto-generated by RadDocking.
	
	* __SplitContainerCreated__ - Raised when a SplitContainer instance is internally auto-generated by RadDocking.
	
Using the ElementCreatedEventArgs provided by each of the above events, the user could get information about the root UIElement that raises the event and the newly generated element - ToolWindow, PaneGroup or SplitContainer.

>The __ElementCreated__ events are expected to be raised only when the PaneGroup, SplitContainer or ToolWindow are automatically and internally generated by RadDocking, not by the user. The events are not raised when __RadDocking__ is initially loading.

* __Other Events__

	* __Loaded__ - Occurs when the __RadDocking__ has been constructed and added to the object tree.

	* __LayoutUpdated__ - Occurs when the layout of the visual tree changes.
