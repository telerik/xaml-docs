Read more it the [Appearance]({%slug stepprogressbar-appearance-step%}) section of the documentation.

* __Data binding support__: RadStepProgressBar comes with built-in data binding support which allows you to provide a collection of any objects that can store information for each step. Read more in the [Data Binding]({%slug stepprogressbar-data-binding%}) article.
