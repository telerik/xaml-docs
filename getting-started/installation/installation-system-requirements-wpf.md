We no longer claim a dedicated support for XBAP applications. This is due to the fact that, since Internet Explorer 9, XBAP is disabled by default. We strongly recommend using ClickOnce deployment instead. With this in mind, please note that some of the information in this article may be outdated. Please [contact our support team](https://www.telerik.com/account/support-center/contact-us/technical-support) if you have an inquiry regarding the support for a given control.
