# Scrolling

__RadTreeListView__ provides several scrolling options that can be used to adjust the scrolling experience of the control. 

As RadTreeListView inherits the __RadGridView__ control, it shares most of its features, including the scrolling mechanism. You can see the available features in the RadGridView's [Scrolling]({%slug gridview-scrolling%}) article.
