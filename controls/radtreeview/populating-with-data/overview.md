# {{ site.framework_name }} RadTreeView Overview

In order to display items, you have to populate the __RadTreeView__ control with some data. You can do this in two ways:

* Manually, by adding items to the __Items__ collection.
* With data binding, by using the __ItemsSource__ property.

>You can't have items added manually to the __Items__ collection and set the __ItemsSource__ at the same time.
