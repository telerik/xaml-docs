# {{ site.framework_name }} RadChart Template Structure



Like most controls, the __RadChart__ also allow you to template it in order to change the control from the inside. Except for templating the whole control, you can template only parts of it. This topic will make you familiar with the structure of the __RadChart's__ templates.
