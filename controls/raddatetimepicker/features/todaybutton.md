# {{ site.framework_name }} RadDateTimePicker Today Button

With the Q1 2016 release of UI for {% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %}, Telerik introduced the Today button to provide the ability to select the current date and time of __RadDateTimePicker__. By default the button is not visible. However, you can make it visible by setting the __TodayButtonVisibility__ to __Visible__. You are also able to change the current content of the button using the __TodayButtonContent__.

>When the __InputMode__ is set to __DatePicker__ and the user presses the Today button, only the current date will be selected. When the __InputMode__ is set to __TimePicker__ and the user presses the Today button, the current time will be selected.

#### __[XAML] TodayButtonVisibility and TodayButtonContent__

{{region xaml-raddatetimepicker-todaybutton_0}}
	<telerik:RadDateTimePicker TodayButtonVisibility="Visible" TodayButtonContent="Select Today/Now"/>
{{endregion}}

The final result is shown on the snapshot below:
