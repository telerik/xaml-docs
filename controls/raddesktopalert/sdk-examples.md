# SDK Examples

The [Telerik XAML SDK repository](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/) provides additional demos for most of the Telerik UI for {% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %} controls. The examples demonstrate many specific user case scenarios, that might be really helpful. In this article you can find the complete list of all SDK examples for __RadDesktopAlert__.

## List of all RadDesktopAlert SDK examples:* __[DesktopAlert with ScreenPositionOffset](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/DesktopAlert/DesktopAlertWithScreenPositionOffset)__ - This example demonstrates how to set a ScreenPositionOffset to RadDesktopAlert through the DesktopAlertManager's constructor in order to visualize it relatively within the Window of your application.
* __[Showing and Hiding using AnimationGroup](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/DesktopAlert/ShowingAndHidingUsingAnimationGroup)__ - This example demonstrates how to set and use simultaneously multiple animations and single animation for showing and hiding RadDesktopAlert.


>You can also check the [SDK Samples Browser]({%slug sdk-samples-browser%}) that provides a more convenient approach in exploring and executing the examples in the Telerik XAML SDK repository. The SDK Samples Browser application is available for download from [this link](http://demos.telerik.com/xaml-sdkbrowser/).
