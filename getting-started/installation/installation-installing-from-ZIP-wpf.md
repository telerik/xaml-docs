# Installing UI for WPF from ZIP File

The following topic describes what steps you should perform in order to install Telerik UI for WPF manually from a __ZIP__ file. The [ZIP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_%28file_format%29) is used for manual (advanced) installs and upgrading/updating purposes.

>tipFor more information about which installation package you need to install, read [here]({%slug installation-installing-which-file-do-i-need%}).
      
>tipFor more information about the system requirements, read [here]({%slug installation-system-requirements-wpf%}).

With the Q1 2014 release we no longer provide the full ZIP package. Instead you could download the Hotfix ZIP and if needed download the Themes separately. In the following sections we will go through the download process for Q1 2014 release as well as the previous versions.

## From Q1 2014 afterwards

### Downloading ZIP Package

* Go to to the UI for WPF download page following the instructions in [Download Product Files]({%slug download-product-files-wpf%}) topic.

* Download the ZIP file and extract it in the desired location.

### Exploring the Extracted Folders

Once the archived folders are extracted you will probably note the following folder structure:

* __Binaries__ - the standard binaries.              

* __Binaries.NoXaml__ - binaries without XAML.              

* __LicenseAgreements__

* __Themes.Implicit__ - implicit styles friendly XAML.
              
>importantWith the Q1 2014 release we no longer provide the Themes and pdb files within the installation package. You could download them separately from the UI for WPF download page in your [Telerik account](http://www.telerik.com/account.aspx).
              
>The WPF Demos application can be downloaded from the UI for WPF download page (in the [Telerik account](http://www.telerik.com/account.aspx)) as a separate ZIP file as well.
