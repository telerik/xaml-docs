# {{ site.framework_name }} RadMap Disposing RadMap

The RadMap control usually needs to be disposed when you no longer use it. This will release all resources used by the map. To do this you can manually call the __Dispose__ method of the RadMap control.

> The map is not disposed by default. You need to do this manually.

#### __[C#] Example 1: Disposing RadMap__
{{region radmap-how-to-dispose-radmap-0}}
	radMap.Dispose();
{{endregion}}

The [providers]({%slug radmap-features-providers%}) and the [VisualizationLayer]({%slug radmap-visualization-layer-introduction%}) also expose a Dispose method. This is useful if you want to change the layer or provider instances at run-time and release their resources.
