# Group Filtering

In this article we will show you how to apply different filters on your RowGroupDescriptions and ColumnGroupDescriptions.
    

## Filter Types

The Data in __RadPivotGrid__ can be filtered based on several conditions to give you a view on specific details or just to make the report shorter. There are three types of filters you may use on your __RowGroupDescriptions__/__ColumnGroupDescriptions__.        

* __Label filter__ - filters the report based on the Header name.

* __Value filter__ - filters the report based on one of the aggregates used.

* __Top 10 filter__ - filters the report based on one of the aggregates used, but shows top/bottom results of applied filter.

## Label Filter

The __LabelFilter__ is used for filtering the data based on the Headers (row or column). The LabelFilter is using one of the following conditions:    		

* __equals__ - showing only groups which header fully match the parameter we pass.    				

* __does not equal__ - showing all groups which header does NOT match the parameter we pass.    				

* __is greater than__ - show only groups which header is greater than the parameter we pass. Note that you should put in the whole header value which has to be matched. For example if you have headers *"Data1"*, *"Data2"*, *"Data3"* and you set this condition with parameter *"Data1"* you will see only *"Data2"* and *"Data3"* in __RadPivotGrid__, but if you set the parameter of the condition to *"Data"* then all of the groups will show as all of them *are greater than* "Data" by string comparison.    				

* __is greater than or equal to__ - showing only groups which header is greater or equal of the parameter we pass.    				

* __is less than__ - show only groups which header is smaller than the parameter we pass.    				

* __is less than or equal to__ - showing only groups which header is smaller is or equal of the parameter we pass. Note that the full header text has to match in order to apply the equal comparison.   				

* __begins with__ - showing only groups which header starts with the parameter we pass.    				

* __does not begin with__ - showing only groups which header does NOT start with the parameter we pass.    				

* __ends with__ - showing only groups which header ends with the parameter we pass.    				

* __does not end with__ - showing only groups which header does NOT end with the parameter we pass.
    				
* __contains__ - showing only groups which header contains the parameter we pass.    				

* __does not contain__ - showing only groups which header does NOT contain the parameter we pass.    				

* __is between__ - showing only groups which header is between the two parameters we pass.    				

* __is not between__ - showing only groups which header is NOT between the two parameters we pass.    				

>importantAll conditions are case sensitive and are using string comparison between the headers of the groups and the passed parameters.

So if we apply a __LabelFilter__ of __RadPivotGrid__ from GettingStarted article with condition *begins with* and parameter *"P"* we will receive the following result:

### Defining Label Filter

__Label Filter__ can be defined in the __XAML__, code behind or even at runtime by using __RadPivotFieldList__. To apply Label Filter you should set it to the *GroupFilter* property of the PropertyGroupDescription/DoubleGroupDescription/DateTimeGroupDescription. To define Label Filter, use the __LabelGroupFilter__ class from __Telerik.Pivot.Core.Filtering__ namespace. Each __LabelGroupFilter__ must have a *Condition* defined. The *Condition* can be:    					

* __ComparisonCondition__ - used to compare the Header with the value set in the *Than* property based on the *Condition* property.

* __IntervalCondition__ - used when you want to show only data that is (not) between two values set in the *From* and *To* properties based on the *Condition* property.

* __SetCondition__ - used when you want to show only particular items that include/does not include particular items defined in the *Items* property based on the *Comparison* property.    							

* __TextCondition__ - used when you want to filter the data based on a string value defined in *Pattern* property. The *Comparison* property gives different options for the comparison method.    							

* __ItemsFilterCondition__ - used when you want to apply to conditions simultaneously (it is mandatory one of them to be SetCondition). *ItemsFilterCondition* has property Condition where you can set an instance of Comparison, Interval or Text condtions. The property DistinctCondition needs an instance of SetCondition.                  

#### __XAML__

{{region radpivotgrid-features-filter_1}}
	<pivot:DateTimeGroupDescription PropertyName="Date" Step="Month">
	    <pivot:DateTimeGroupDescription.GroupFilter>
	        <pivot:LabelGroupFilter>
	            <pivot:LabelGroupFilter.Condition>
	                <pivot:TextCondition Comparison="BeginsWith" Pattern="Pe"/>
	            </pivot:LabelGroupFilter.Condition>
	        </pivot:LabelGroupFilter>
	    </pivot:DateTimeGroupDescription.GroupFilter>
	</pivot:DateTimeGroupDescription>
{{endregion}}

#### __C#__

{{region radpivotgrid-features-filter_1}}
	DateTimeGroupDescription dateTimeGroupDescription = new DateTimeGroupDescription();
	dateTimeGroupDescription.PropertyName = "Date";
	dateTimeGroupDescription.Step = DateTimeStep.Month;
	LabelGroupFilter labelFilter = new LabelGroupFilter();
	TextCondition textCondition = new TextCondition();
	textCondition.Pattern = "Pe";
	textCondition.Comparison = TextComparison.BeginsWith;
	labelFilter.Condition = textCondition;
	dateTimeGroupDescription.GroupFilter = labelFilter;
{{endregion}}

#### __VB.NET__

{{region radpivotgrid-features-filter_1}}
	Dim dateTimeGroupDescription As New DateTimeGroupDescription()
	dateTimeGroupDescription.PropertyName = "Date"
	dateTimeGroupDescription.Step = DateTimeStep.Month
	Dim labelFilter As New LabelGroupFilter()
	Dim textCondition As New TextCondition()
	textCondition.Pattern = "Pe"
	textCondition.Comparison = TextComparison.BeginsWith
	labelFilter.Condition = textCondition
	dateTimeGroupDescription.GroupFilter = labelFilter
{{endregion}}

And here is how to apply ItemsFilterCondition:              

#### __XAML__

{{region radpivotgrid-features-filter_4}}
	<pivot:PropertyGroupDescription PropertyName="Name" >
	    <pivot:PropertyGroupDescription.GroupFilter>
	        <pivot:LabelGroupFilter>
	            <pivot:LabelGroupFilter.Condition>
	                <pivot:ItemsFilterCondition>
	                    <pivot:ItemsFilterCondition.DistinctCondition>
	                        <pivot:SetCondition Comparison="Includes">
	                            <pivot:SetCondition.Items>
	                                <sys:String>Pencil</sys:String>
	                                <sys:String>Pen</sys:String>
	                            </pivot:SetCondition.Items>
	                        </pivot:SetCondition>
	                    </pivot:ItemsFilterCondition.DistinctCondition>
	                    <pivot:ItemsFilterCondition.Condition>
	                        <pivot:TextCondition Comparison="Contains" Pattern="c" />
	                    </pivot:ItemsFilterCondition.Condition>
	                </pivot:ItemsFilterCondition>
	            </pivot:LabelGroupFilter.Condition>
	        </pivot:LabelGroupFilter>
	    </pivot:PropertyGroupDescription.GroupFilter>
	</pivot:PropertyGroupDescription>
{{endregion}}

#### __C#__

{{region radpivotgrid-features-filter_4}}
	Telerik.Pivot.Core.PropertyGroupDescription propertyGroupDescription = new Telerik.Pivot.Core.PropertyGroupDescription();
	propertyGroupDescription.PropertyName = "Name";
	
	var labelFilter = new LabelGroupFilter();
	var textCondition = new TextCondition();
	textCondition.Pattern = "c";
	textCondition.Comparison = TextComparison.Contains;
	
	var setCondition = new SetCondition();
	setCondition.Comparison = SetComparison.Includes;
	setCondition.Items.Add("Pen");
	setCondition.Items.Add("Pencil");
	
	var itemsFilterCondition = new ItemsFilterCondition();
	itemsFilterCondition.Condition = textCondition;
	itemsFilterCondition.DistinctCondition = setCondition;
	
	labelFilter.Condition = itemsFilterCondition;
	propertyGroupDescription.GroupFilter = labelFilter;
{{endregion}}



#### __VB.NET__

{{region radpivotgrid-features-filter_4}}
	Dim propertyGroupDescription As New Telerik.Pivot.Core.PropertyGroupDescription()
	propertyGroupDescription.PropertyName = "Name"
	
	Dim labelFilter = New LabelGroupFilter()
	Dim textCondition = New TextCondition()
	textCondition.Pattern = "c"
	textCondition.Comparison = TextComparison.Contains
	
	Dim setCondition = New SetCondition()
	setCondition.Comparison = SetComparison.Includes
	setCondition.Items.Add("Pen")
	setCondition.Items.Add("Pencil")
	
	Dim itemsFilterCondition = New ItemsFilterCondition()
	itemsFilterCondition.Condition = textCondition
	itemsFilterCondition.DistinctCondition = setCondition
	
	labelFilter.Condition = itemsFilterCondition
	propertyGroupDescription.GroupFilter = labelFilter
{{endregion}}

This way the only visible item will be Pencil as it is part of the SetCondition and also has "c" in its name which satisfies the text condition.

## Value Filter

__Value Filter__ is applied on __RowGroupDescriptions__/__ColumnGroupDescriptions__ based on the *GrandTotals* of one of the Aggregation descriptions used in the application. To apply value filter you have to use one of the predefined conditions:    		

* __equals__ - showing only groups which header fully matches the parameter we pass.    				

* __does not equal__ - showing all groups which header does NOT match the parameter we pass.    				

* __is greater than__ - show only groups which header is greater than the parameter we pass.    				

* __is greater than or equal to__ - showing only groups which header is greater or equal of the parameter we pass.    				

* __is less than__ - show only groups which header is smaller than the parameter we pass.    				

* __is less than or equal to__ - showing only groups which header is smaller is or equal of the parameter we pass.    				

* __is between__ - showing only groups which header is between the two parameters we pass.    				

* __is not between__ - showing only groups which header is NOT between the two parameters we pass.    				

>important__Value Filter__ is filtering the groups by number comparison between the *GrandTotals* of the groups and the parameters we pass, while __Label Filter__ is a string filter.

So if we apply a __Value Filter__ on the *Name* RowGroupDescription from the __GettingStarted__ article, set condition *"is greater than"* and pass as parameter value 10 we will notice that one of the items is missing because its *GrandTotal* is less than 10.

__RadPivotGrid__ without __Value Filter__:

__RadPivotGrid__ after __Value Filter__ is applied:

![Rad Pivot Grid Features Filtering 03](images/RadPivotGrid_Features_Filtering_03.png)Defining Value Filter

__Value Filter__ can be defined in __XAML__, code behind or at runtime by using __RadPivotFieldList__. Defining in the code is using *ValueGroupFilter* class from __Telerik.Pivot.Core__ namespace. Each object of this type must have *Condition* defined. *Condition* can be any of these:    					

* __ComparisonCondition__ - used to compare the Header with the value set in the *Than* property based on the *Condition* property.

* __IntervalCondition__ - used when you want to show only data that is (not) between two values set in the *From* and *To* properties based on the *Condition* property.

## Top 10 filter

__Top 10 filter__ is used when you want to show only the top/bottom items based on some criteria. The criteria is one of the Aggregate Descriptions used in the application. You can show the exact count of top/bottom items to show based on the selected aggregate description, the top items which sum is near the one you set as parameter or the top/bottom items which sum presents percent of the GrandTotal (you choose the percent).    		

For example if you have the following RadPivotGrid:

![Rad Pivot Grid Features Filtering 04](images/RadPivotGrid_Features_Filtering_04.png)

And you apply a Top 10 filter on the Date columns to show the top 4 items based on the Average Price Aggregate Description the result will be:

![Rad Pivot Grid Features Filtering 05](images/RadPivotGrid_Features_Filtering_05.png)

Defining Top 10 filter

You can define *Top 10 filter* in the __XAML__, in the code behind or at runtime by using __RadPivotFieldList__. When defining this filter you have to note that __PropertyGroupDescription__, __DoubleGroupDescription__ and __DateTimeGroupDescription__ all have *GroupFilter* property. To apply *Top 10 filter* you can set as *GroupFilter* any of the following: __GroupsCountFilter__, __GroupsPercentFilter__, __GroupsSumFilter__.    					

* __GroupsCountFilter__ - selects a specific number of groups sorted by a given criteria. It is important to define the *Count* property which indicates the number of groups that will be shown, *Selection* property, which defines if the Top or Bottom groups will be shown and *AggregateIndex* property which defines which Aggregate Description will be used for the filter.    							

* __GroupsPercentFilter__ - selects groups until the sum of their aggregates reaches a given percent of their total. It is important to define the *Percent* property which indicates the percentage of GrandTotal that selected groups should reach, *Selection* property, which defines if the Top or Bottom groups will be shown and *AggregateIndex* property which defines which Aggregate Description will be used for the filter.

>The *Percent* property is of type double. If you define value higher than 1.00 it will represent it as 100%.

* __GroupsSumFilter__ - selects from the groups until sum of their GrandTotals reaches a given number. It is important to define the *Sum* property which indicates the Sum of GrandTotal that selected groups should reach, *Selection* property, which defines if the Top or Bottom groups will be shown and *AggregateIndex* property which defines which Aggregate Description will be used for the filter.

#### __XAML__

{{region radpivotgrid-features-filter_3}}
	<pivot:DateTimeGroupDescription PropertyName="Date" Step="Month">
	    <pivot:DateTimeGroupDescription.GroupFilter>
	        <pivot:GroupsCountFilter AggregateIndex="0" Count="4" Selection="Top" />
	    </pivot:DateTimeGroupDescription.GroupFilter>
	</pivot:DateTimeGroupDescription>
{{endregion}}

#### __C#__

{{region radpivotgrid-features-filter_3}}
	DateTimeGroupDescription dateTimeGroupDescription = new DateTimeGroupDescription();
	dateTimeGroupDescription.PropertyName = "Date";
	dateTimeGroupDescription.Step = DateTimeStep.Month;
	GroupsCountFilter countFilter = new GroupsCountFilter();
	countFilter.Count = 4;
	countFilter.Selection = SortedListSelection.Top;
	countFilter.AggregateIndex = 0;
	dateTimeGroupDescription.GroupFilter = countFilter;
{{endregion}}

#### __VB.NET__

{{region radpivotgrid-features-filter_3}}
	Dim dateTimeGroupDescription As New DateTimeGroupDescription()
	dateTimeGroupDescription.PropertyName = "Date"
	dateTimeGroupDescription.Step = DateTimeStep.Month
	Dim countFilter As New GroupsCountFilter()
	countFilter.Count = 4
	countFilter.Selection = SortedListSelection.Top
	countFilter.AggregateIndex = 0
	dateTimeGroupDescription.GroupFilter = countFilter
{{endregion}}

## Applying filter at runtime

You can apply any of the filters at runtime by using __RadPivotFieldList__. When you click on any of the RowGroupDescriptions or ColumnGroupDescriptions you will see a menu with several options. Three of them are used for filtering: *"Label Filter"*, *"Value Filter"*,* "Top 10 filter"*:

![Rad Pivot Grid Features Filtering 06](images/RadPivotGrid_Features_Filtering_06.png)

When you choose any of them a new Dialog window will help you to adjust the needed attributes. Note that you can always remove applied filters by using the additional option from the drop-down content:
