## 

Each class that descends from __FrameworkElement__ has a dependency property named __Tag__. The type of the __Tag__ property is object and you can use it to store arbitrary object value about this element.

For example you can store some custom data like ID, type, name or anything else that will help you identify your object on a later stage.
