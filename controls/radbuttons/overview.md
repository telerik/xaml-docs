## Key Features

The following list presents the most popular features in Telerik's __RadButtons__:

* __DropDown Button__: Provides a menu-like interface model within a button. It can be very handy for creating a more simplistic UI where extensive menus and/or ComboBoxes are not needed. Any kind of content can be placed in the pop-up area displayed upon the activation of the button. See the [DropDown Button]({%slug radbuttons-features-dropdown-button%}) article for more details.

* __Split Button__: Extends the __DropDown Button's__ functionality with an action area like in a standard button. The Split Button implements the __IsChecked__ state, too. See the [Split Button]({%slug radbuttons-features-split-button%}) article for more details.

* __Toggle Button__: Mimics the functionality of a check box, but has more flexibility in its design. It offers state management based on the check state of the control. See the [Toggle Button]({%slug radbuttons-features-toggle-button%}) article for more details.

* __Toggle Switch Button__: Mimics the functionality of a Toggle button, but has more flexibility in its design. You can specify two states: Check/Uncheck and On/Off. Every state can be customized with different content. See the [Toggle Switch Button]({%slug radbuttons-features-toggle-switch-button%}) article for more details.

* __Radio Button__: Mimics the functionality of the radio button, but has more flexibility in its design. See the [Radio Button]({%slug radbutton-features-radio-button%}) article for more details.

* __Path Button__: Derives from RadButton, but provides the ability to set a Path alongside its content. See the [Path Button]({%slug radbuttons-features-pathbutton%}) article for more details.

* __Hyperlink Button__: Extends RadButton with hyperlink capabilities. See the [Hyperlink Button]({%slug radbuttons-features-hyperlink-button%}) article for more details.

* __Command Support__: The full implementation of the Command pattern is available by using RadButtons. You can build complex UIs and keep your code simple by using Commands. See the [Commands]({%slug radbuttons-features-commands%}) article for more details.
